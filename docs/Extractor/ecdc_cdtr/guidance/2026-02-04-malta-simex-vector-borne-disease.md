# ECDC supports Malta in strengthening country preparedness through simulation exercise on vector-borne disease outbreak

**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Source**: ECDC News
**Category**: Guidance (Preparedness Training)

## Summary

On 26 January 2025, ECDC supported Malta in conducting a simulation exercise (SIMEX) focused on strengthening national preparedness and response capabilities for vector-borne disease outbreaks. The exercise simulated a **chikungunya disease outbreak** and brought together multi-sectoral professionals to test coordination mechanisms using a One Health approach.

## Exercise Details

**Event**: Simulation Exercise (SIMEX)
**Date of Exercise**: 26 January 2025
**Location**: Malta
**Simulated Disease**: Chikungunya (vector-borne disease)
**Coordination**: EU Health Task Force (EUHTF)

## Participants

The exercise engaged professionals from multiple sectors:

- Public health authorities
- Hospital care providers
- Primary healthcare services
- Laboratory personnel
- Civil protection agencies
- Environmental health specialists
- Veterinary representatives

**International Observers**: Representatives from Cyprus and Liechtenstein attended to learn best practices for their own countries.

## Objectives

The SIMEX aimed to:
1. Identify good practices in emergency preparedness and response
2. Recognize challenges in existing arrangements
3. Discover opportunities for improvement
4. Enhance cross-sectoral coordination and communication
5. Strengthen joint decision-making capabilities

## Key Approach

The exercise emphasized a **One Health approach**, integrating:
- Human health
- Animal health
- Environmental health

This multi-sectoral integration is critical for vector-borne disease preparedness, as these diseases involve environmental vectors (mosquitoes), animal reservoirs, and human health impacts.

## ECDC's Role

- Organizational support for the SIMEX
- Coordination through the EU Health Task Force
- Provision of technical expertise
- Facilitation of cross-border learning (observers from Cyprus and Liechtenstein)

## Significance

### Why Chikungunya?

Chikungunya is a vector-borne viral disease transmitted primarily by *Aedes* mosquitoes (same vectors as dengue and Zika). Climate change is expanding the geographical range of these vectors into European regions, making preparedness exercises increasingly important.

### EU Health Task Force

The EUHTF provides rapid support to EU/EEA countries during public health threats, facilitating coordinated responses across member states.

### Capacity Building

This type of simulation exercise:
- Tests existing protocols without real-world consequences
- Identifies gaps in coordination mechanisms
- Builds institutional memory and relationships
- Enhances readiness for actual outbreaks

## Public Health Implications

**Preparedness Level**: National capacity strengthening
**Geographic Scope**: Malta (with regional learning for Cyprus and Liechtenstein)
**Threat Type**: Vector-borne diseases (specifically arboviral infections)
**Response Mechanism**: Multi-sectoral coordination using One Health approach

## Related Context

Vector-borne diseases are expanding their range in Europe due to:
- Climate change enabling mosquito vector survival in new areas
- Increased international travel and trade
- Urbanization creating suitable vector habitats

Regular simulation exercises help EU/EEA countries maintain readiness for emerging vector-borne disease threats.
