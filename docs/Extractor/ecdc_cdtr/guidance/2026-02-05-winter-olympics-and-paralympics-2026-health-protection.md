# Winter Olympics and Paralympics 2026: Health Protection Guidance

## Summary

ECDC has published comprehensive health protection guidance for attendees of the 2026 Winter Olympics (6-22 February) and Paralympics (6-15 March) in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The guidance covers vaccination requirements, respiratory infection prevention, food safety, sexually transmitted infection risks, and medical access for international visitors.

## Key Health Recommendations

### Vaccination Requirements

- **Measles**: MMR vaccination emphasized due to global measles transmission and outbreaks
- **Timing**: Full immunization protection needed at least two weeks before departure
- **Status verification**: All attendees should check their immunization status before traveling

### Respiratory Infection Prevention

Winter mass gatherings pose increased risks for respiratory infections, particularly for vulnerable populations:

**Recommended vaccinations:**
- Seasonal influenza vaccine
- COVID-19 vaccine
- RSV vaccine (for eligible groups)

**Protective measures:**
- Maintain distance from symptomatic individuals
- Frequent handwashing
- Avoid touching face
- Cover nose and mouth when coughing/sneezing
- Wear masks in crowded settings if symptomatic

### Food and Water Safety

- Italian tap water is safe for consumption
- Cook food thoroughly
- Wash fresh produce
- Discard perishable food left at room temperature over 2 hours

### Sexually Transmitted Infections

**Common STIs in Europe:**
- Chlamydia
- Gonorrhea
- Syphilis
- HIV
- Hepatitis
- Mpox

**Protection measures:**
- Use condoms
- Get tested after unprotected sexual encounters

### Medical Access

- EU citizens can use European Health Insurance Card for necessary medical care
- Lombardy region provides dedicated emergency service information online

## Public Health Significance

This guidance reflects ECDC's proactive approach to mass gathering events, addressing multiple health risks simultaneously. The emphasis on measles vaccination aligns with ongoing global measles outbreaks. The comprehensive nature of the guidance (respiratory infections, STIs, food safety) demonstrates understanding of diverse health risks at international sporting events.
