# Epidemiological update: SARS-CoV-2 and NB.1.8.1 variant assessment

## 基本資訊
- **來源**: ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report
- **發布日期**: 2025-06-13
- **疾病**: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
- **病原體變異株**: NB.1.8.1 (classified as variant under monitoring - VUM)
- **地理位置**: Asia (China, Hong Kong, Singapore) with implications for Europe

## 事件摘要
Increases in infections due to SARS-CoV-2, associated with an increase in detections of the NB.1.8.1 variant, have been observed in some countries in Asia (including China, Hong Kong, Singapore) in recent weeks. ECDC and WHO have classified NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring (VUM).

## 流行病學資訊
- **病例數**: Increases observed (specific numbers not provided in RSS)
- **傳播模式**: Community transmission with increasing trend
- **受影響地區**: China, Hong Kong, Singapore (Asia)
- **病毒變異**: NB.1.8.1 variant (VUM classification)

## 公衛意義
- NB.1.8.1 variant has been classified as a variant under monitoring (VUM) by ECDC and WHO
- Increases in Asia may signal potential spread to other regions including Europe
- Continued genomic surveillance is important for early detection of variant spread
- VUM classification indicates need for enhanced monitoring without immediate alarm

## 備註
- Classification as VUM indicates moderate concern level (lower than variant of interest or concern)
- Geographic pattern suggests international surveillance coordination is important
