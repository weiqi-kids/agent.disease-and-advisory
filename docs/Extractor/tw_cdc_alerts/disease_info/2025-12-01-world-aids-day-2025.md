## 詳細內容

### Event Overview

In support of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control held a news conference on December 1 marking the 2025 World AIDS Day, echoing the theme of "Overcoming Disruption, Transforming the AIDS Response." The event, titled "Breaking Myths and Staying True to Love," was attended by:

- Taiwan CDC Director-General Yi-Chun Lo
- Deputy Director-General Min-Cheng Lin
- Taiwan AIDS Society President Po-Liang Lu
- Members of the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Protection of Rights Committee
- Several HIV prevention advocacy groups

### Interactive Activities

Taiwan CDC invited TWeen drag queens Chiang Wei, Hannah, and Bagel to perform at the opening of the news conference. Their bold and diverse personas aimed to dispel misconceptions and stigma surrounding HIV while promoting values of respect and inclusion.

The event featured "Breaking Through Myths, Tearing Off Labels," an interactive activity symbolizing:
- Removal of common misconceptions about HIV
- Promotion of accurate knowledge
- Eradication of prejudice

The conference concluded with a multilingual performance of the HIV awareness song "As Usual" in Chinese, English, and Japanese by representatives of the Federation of Public Health Student Associations in Taiwan. The performance conveyed the core message of U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable), reinforcing public understanding and celebrating diversity and inclusion.

### Taiwan's HIV Statistics and Progress

**Recent Trends:**
- Taiwan's HIV trend has shown an overall decline since 2018
- As of October 2025: 744 newly reported HIV cases
- Decrease of 89 cases (–11%) compared with the 833 cases during the same period in 2024

**Care Cascade Indicators (2024):**
Taiwan achieved **92-96-95** metrics:
- 92% of people living with HIV know their status
- 96% of those diagnosed are receiving treatment
- 95% of those under treatment have achieved viral suppression

These results surpass global averages of 87-89-94, demonstrating the high effectiveness of Taiwan's HIV prevention and control efforts.

### Prevention and Testing Initiatives

**Safe Sex Practices:**
Taiwan CDC encourages:
- Consistent and correct condom use
- Use of water-based lubricants
- Effective prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)

**Testing Accessibility:**
Despite significant progress, approximately 8% of people living with HIV in Taiwan remain unaware of their infection. Both Taiwanese citizens and foreign residents are encouraged to undergo regular testing through:

1. **HIV Self-Testing**: Free shipping on HIV self-test kits via official website (https://hiva.cdc.gov.tw/Selftest/) through December 31, 2025 (standard NT$45 shipping fee waived; note: users redeeming free test vouchers still pay shipping)

2. **Anonymous STI Consultation Service**: Launched in July 2025, providing anonymous, friendly, and professional STI consultation through designated one-stop anonymous testing hospitals nationwide

3. **Free Rapid Syphilis Testing**: Available to individuals aged 24 and under, including students

### Long-term Goals

Taiwan CDC will continue to collaborate with government agencies and community partners to:
- Advance HIV prevention
- Eliminate discrimination
- Build a supportive environment
- Promote health equity

**Target Achievement:**
- UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets
