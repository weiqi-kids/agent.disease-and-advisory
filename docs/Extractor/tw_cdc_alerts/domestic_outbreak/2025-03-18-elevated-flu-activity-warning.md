## 詳細內容

### Current Situation

During the 11th week of 2025 (March 9-15), Taiwan recorded approximately 108,000 outpatient and emergency visits for influenza-like illness. Though declining, "influenza activity remains high," with influenza A (H1N1) as the predominant strain.

### Case Statistics

**Season Total (October 1, 2024 - March 17, 2025):**
- 1,152 severe cases (1,075 H1N1, 54 H3N2, 9 untyped A, 14 B)
- 254 deaths (243 H1N1, 8 H3N2, 3 B)
- 58% of severe cases occurred in adults 65+
- Recent week: 45 new severe cases and 15 deaths

### Global Context

The virus spreads internationally with varied patterns: the US and Canada remain above epidemic thresholds with both H3N2 and H1N1 co-circulating, while Korea shows influenza B dominance and Europe displays mixed H3 and B circulation.

### Public Health Recommendations

Taiwan CDC urges citizens to watch for symptoms including "fever, headache, sore throat, cough, and muscle aches." Seek immediate care if experiencing warning signs like breathing difficulty, altered consciousness, or fever exceeding 72 hours. The agency expanded eligibility for government-funded antiviral medications through March 31, 2025.
