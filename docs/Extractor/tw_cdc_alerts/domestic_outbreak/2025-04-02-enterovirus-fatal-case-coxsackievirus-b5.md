## 摘要
Taiwan CDC reported a fatal case of enterovirus infection caused by Coxsackievirus B5 in a one-year-old boy from southern Taiwan. This marks the first severe case from this strain in 2025. February-March saw 4 severe cases (including 3 deaths), the highest for this period in five years, prompting warnings about enterovirus risks especially in children under 5.

## 詳細內容

### The Case
Taiwan's health authorities documented a fatal infection in a one-year-old boy from southern Taiwan. The child showed "fever and respiratory symptoms" in early March, progressing to seizures and consciousness changes within two days. Medical teams diagnosed acute encephalitis and admitted him to intensive pediatric care, but "his condition deteriorated rapidly due to encephalitis, and he passed away on the sixth day after symptom onset." Laboratory analysis identified Coxsackievirus B5 as the cause.

### Surveillance Findings
While general enterovirus activity remains subdued, the situation warrants concern. From February through March 2025, health officials recorded four severe cases—the highest count for this period in five years. Among these, three resulted from Echovirus 11 and one from Coxsackievirus B5. Two affected newborns under one month old. Current prevalence shows "Coxsackievirus A16 as the predominant strain, followed by Echovirus 11 and Coxsackievirus A6."

### Public Health Guidance
Authorities emphasize protecting vulnerable populations, particularly infants and young children under five. Families should teach proper hand hygiene using "the five-step method: wet, lather, scrub, rinse, and dry" before meals and after outings. Critically, "children should stay home when sick to protect themselves and others," especially during the upcoming Tomb-Sweeping Holiday when travel increases transmission risks.
