## 摘要
Taiwan CDC announced the launch of the 2025 publicly funded influenza and COVID-19 vaccination program on October 1, providing approximately 6.48 million flu vaccine doses and 2.99 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. The program features a two-phase rollout targeting vulnerable populations first, then expanding to adults aged 50+ in November.

## 詳細內容

### Program Overview
Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control announced a publicly funded vaccination initiative on October 1, 2025, providing approximately 6.48 million doses of trivalent influenza vaccines and 2.99 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

### Two-Phase Rollout

**Phase 1 (October 1):** Targets vulnerable populations including adults 65+, indigenous people 55+, children 6 months to under 6 years, individuals with high-risk chronic diseases, pregnant women, parents of infants under six months, and healthcare/childcare workers.

**Phase 2 (November 1):** Expands to include adults 50+ without high-risk chronic diseases.

### Key Official Statement
Minister Shih emphasized that "both influenza and COVID-19 can pose serious threats to public health, particularly among the elderly" and stressed vaccination as "the most effective preventive measure."

Campaign Ambassador Chen-nan Tsai highlighted the "Three Golden Advantages"—benefits, convenience, and safety—urging eligible individuals to "get vaccinated as soon as possible."

### Access Information
Nearly 4,000 healthcare facilities nationwide provide these services. The public can locate facilities through local health departments, the Taiwan CDC website, the official LINE account "疾管家," or by calling 1922.
