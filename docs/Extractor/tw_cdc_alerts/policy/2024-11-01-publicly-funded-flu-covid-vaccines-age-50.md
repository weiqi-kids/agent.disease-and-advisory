## 詳細內容

### Program Launch
Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control officially began phase two of its 2025 vaccination initiative on November 1st, expanding eligibility to adults aged 50-64 without chronic diseases. The program aims to strengthen community immunity and safeguard public health.

### Key Details
Director-General Yi-chun Lo emphasized that while older adults face higher risks, "healthy adults also face increasing risks as immunity declines with age." Those in the expanded age group often support their families and should prioritize vaccination.

### Vaccination Access
Taiwan CDC partnered with PX Mart to establish approximately 120 vaccination stations nationwide. Citizens can receive shots while running errands or accompanying family members. Over 4,400 contracted healthcare facilities also provide services. Vaccinated individuals receive special health gifts from PX Mart.

### Campaign Ambassadors
Celebrities Tsu-wu Hsieh and Ai-ling Chu, both eligible for phase two, were vaccinated on-site. Hsieh stated that "vaccination is the most reliable protection," emphasizing benefits for both individuals and communities. Chu demonstrated her annual vaccination commitment.

### Finding Vaccination Sites
The public can locate nearby stations through:
- Taiwan CDC's "Influenza and COVID-19 Vaccine & Antiviral Map"
- The LINE account "疾管家"
- The hotline 1922
