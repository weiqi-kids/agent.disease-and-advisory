## 詳細內容

### Partnership Overview
Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control has collaborated with Carrefour to expand access to publicly funded flu and COVID-19 vaccinations. The second phase of the program launched November 1, with vaccination stations established at 33 Carrefour locations nationwide.

### Key Statements

**Director-General Yi-Chun Lo** emphasized the importance of timely vaccination, noting: "autumn and winter are peak seasons for flu and COVID-19, and...another wave may occur in mid-to-late December."

**Taoyuan City Deputy Mayor Ming-jiuh Wang** reported strong uptake, stating the city's "utilization rate of public vaccines...has reached around 80%."

**Carrefour Taiwan Northern Regional Director Huai-sheng Wang** explained the retailer's involvement, noting the chain's "extensive store network and high foot traffic" made it suitable for vaccination services.

### Incentives and Access
Carrefour is offering free shopping bags and fresh fruit to vaccinated customers. Around 4,400 contracted healthcare facilities provide publicly funded vaccination services across Taiwan.

### Public Health Recommendations
Officials urge eligible citizens to receive vaccinations early and maintain hygiene practices including handwashing and mask-wearing. The CDC recommends calling ahead to minimize wait times and provides information via their official LINE account "疾管家" or the hotline 1922.
