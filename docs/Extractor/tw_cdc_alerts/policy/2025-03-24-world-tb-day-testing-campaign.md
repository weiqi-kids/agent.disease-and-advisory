## 摘要
Taiwan CDC launched a World TB Day campaign on March 24, 2025, offering free latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing for previously exposed individuals through May 24. Taiwan has achieved a 63% reduction in TB incidence since 2005, with the 2024 rate at 27 per 100,000 population. LTBI treatment provides over 90% protection against progression to active disease.

## 詳細內容

### Campaign Overview

Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control held a press conference on March 24, 2025, to promote latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing and treatment as part of World Tuberculosis Day observances. The initiative aligns with the global theme "Yes! We Can End TB: Commit, Invest, Deliver."

### Testing Program Details

The campaign offers free LTBI testing for individuals previously exposed to tuberculosis from March 24 through May 24, 2025. Participants who test positive for latent infection are encouraged to contact public health personnel and begin treatment, which provides "over 90% protection against progression." Those undergoing testing and treatment during this period can enter a lucky draw.

### Key Statistics

Taiwan demonstrated significant progress in TB control:

- **2024 incidence rate:** 27 per 100,000 population (6,222 cases)
- **Reduction since 2005:** 63% decrease from 73 per 100,000 population (16,472 cases)
- **Testing results:** 115,547 people tested for LTBI in 2024; 13,791 tested positive began treatment

### Health Official Statements

Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang credited collaborative efforts across government, healthcare institutions, and NGOs for TB control progress. Officials emphasized that TB is treatable and stressed early detection and complete treatment courses are essential.

High-risk groups identified for priority testing include TB patient contacts, immunocompromised individuals, indigenous populations in mountainous areas, and those with conditions like diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
