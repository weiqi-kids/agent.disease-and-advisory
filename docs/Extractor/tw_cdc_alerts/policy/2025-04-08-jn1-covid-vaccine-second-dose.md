## 摘要
Taiwan CDC announced availability of second JN.1 COVID-19 vaccine dose for high-risk groups starting April 8, 2025. Eligible populations include adults 65+, indigenous individuals 55-64, and immunocompromised persons. A minimum 6-month interval between doses is required. Over 96% of severe cases and deaths occurred among unvaccinated individuals.

## 詳細內容

### Announcement Date
April 8, 2025

### Eligible Groups

Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control made the second dose of the JN.1 COVID-19 vaccine available to three primary populations:

- Adults aged 65 and older
- Indigenous individuals between 55-64 years old
- Immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals aged 6 months and older, including cancer patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, organ/stem cell transplant recipients, those with primary immunodeficiencies, kidney dialysis patients, people living with HIV, and those receiving high-dose immunosuppressive medications

### Timing Requirements

A minimum interval of six months (180 days) between doses is mandatory. Approximately 530,000 elderly Taiwanese were expected to become eligible by month's end.

### Official Statements

Minister Chiu Tai-yuan, who received his first dose in October 2024, became the first recipient of the second dose. He emphasized that "the protection from the first dose of the vaccine begins to wane after three to five months."

The CDC noted that over 96% of domestic COVID-19 deaths and severe cases occurred among unvaccinated individuals, predominantly those aged 65 and older. The JN.1 vaccine provides protection against multiple variants including KP.2, KP.3, XEC, and KP.3.1.1, with Canadian research showing up to 60% effectiveness against severe hospitalization in older adults.
