## 摘要

Comprehensive guidance on two high consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) causing haemorrhagic fever in Bolivia: Machupo virus (MACV) and Chapare virus (CHAPV).

## 詳細內容

There are currently 2 recognised viruses that cause haemorrhagic fever illnesses in Bolivia that are classed as high consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs). These are:

1. **Machupo virus (MACV)** - causes Bolivian haemorrhagic fever
2. **Chapare virus (CHAPV)** - causes Chapare haemorrhagic fever

This guidance document covers:

**Origins and reservoirs:**
- Rodent reservoirs for both viruses
- Geographic distribution within Bolivia
- Environmental factors affecting transmission

**Transmission:**
- Contact with infected rodent excreta
- Person-to-person transmission (particularly CHAPV)
- Aerosol transmission in certain circumstances
- Nosocomial transmission risks

**Clinical guidelines:**
- Recognition and diagnosis
- Case management and supportive care
- Infection prevention and control measures
- Contact tracing and monitoring

**HCID classification implications:**
- Requires specialized isolation facilities
- Enhanced infection control procedures
- Specific reporting and notification requirements
- Coordination with national HCID network

While these infections are rare and geographically limited, the guidance is essential for UK healthcare providers who may encounter imported cases or need to advise travelers to endemic areas in Bolivia.
