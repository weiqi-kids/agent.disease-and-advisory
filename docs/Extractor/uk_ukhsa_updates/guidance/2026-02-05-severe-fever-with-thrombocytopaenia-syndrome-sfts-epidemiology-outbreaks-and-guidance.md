## 摘要

Comprehensive guidance covering the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of severe fever with thrombocytopaenia syndrome (SFTS), an emerging tick-borne viral disease.

## 詳細內容

This guidance document provides detailed information on severe fever with thrombocytopaenia syndrome (SFTS), covering the epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis and management of this emerging infectious disease.

**About SFTS:**
SFTS is a tick-borne viral disease caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. The disease is characterized by:
- Severe fever
- Thrombocytopaenia (low platelet count)
- Leucopenia (low white blood cell count)
- Multi-organ dysfunction
- High case-fatality rate (12-30%)

**Epidemiology:**
- Endemic in East Asia (China, Japan, South Korea)
- Tick-borne transmission (primarily Haemaphysalis longicornis)
- Seasonal pattern (April to October, peak in summer)
- Person-to-person transmission possible through blood contact
- Occupational risk for agricultural workers and those in rural areas

**Clinical presentation:**
- Incubation period: 6-14 days
- Initial symptoms: High fever, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms
- Progression: Hemorrhagic manifestations, neurological symptoms
- Laboratory findings: Thrombocytopaenia, leucopenia, elevated liver enzymes

**Diagnosis and management:**
- PCR testing for SFTSV
- Supportive care (no specific antiviral treatment)
- Monitoring for complications
- Infection prevention and control measures

**Relevance for UK:**
While SFTS is not endemic in the UK, the guidance is important for:
- Diagnosing imported cases in travelers from endemic areas
- Awareness among healthcare providers
- Travel health advice for those visiting affected regions
