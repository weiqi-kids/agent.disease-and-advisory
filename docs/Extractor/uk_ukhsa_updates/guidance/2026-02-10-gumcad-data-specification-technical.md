**Source**: [UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gumcad-data-specification-and-technical-guidance)

## Summary

This technical guidance document supports data managers and software providers in implementing GUMCAD, England's mandatory sexually transmitted infection (STI) surveillance system. The guidance facilitates the recording, extraction and reporting of GUMCAD data from sexual health services.

## Overview

GUMCAD is identified as "the mandatory surveillance system for sexually transmitted infections" that collects data on STI tests, diagnoses, and services from commissioned sexual health services in England.

## Available Resources

The publication provides two key technical resources:

1. **GUMCAD: Data Specification and Technical Guidance** (PDF, 151 pages, updated February 2026)
2. **GUMCAD: Sample Data Extract** (CSV file, 2.08 KB)

## Target Audience

- Data managers in sexual health services
- Software providers developing or maintaining electronic patient record systems
- Technical staff responsible for GUMCAD data extraction and reporting

## Technical Note

The webpage serves as a landing page for accessing the detailed technical documentation. The actual data standards, submission requirements, and system specifications are contained within the 151-page PDF guidance document, which would need to be reviewed for specific implementation details.

## Public Health Context

Standardized data specifications are essential for:
- **Consistent reporting** across diverse sexual health service providers
- **Accurate national surveillance** of STI epidemiology
- **Data quality assurance** through defined technical standards
- **System interoperability** between different electronic health record platforms

## Support

For technical questions, users can contact the UK Health Security Agency at publications@ukhsa.gov.uk.

**Confidence note**: Confidence marked as medium due to limited technical detail available in the webpage content. Full assessment would require review of the complete PDF guidance document.
