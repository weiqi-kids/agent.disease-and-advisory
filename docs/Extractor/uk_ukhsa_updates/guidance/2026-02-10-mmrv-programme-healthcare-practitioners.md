# MMRV programme: information for healthcare practitioners

**Source**: [UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mmrv-programme-information-for-healthcare-practitioners)
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Category**: Guidance
**Feed**: ukhsa_official

## Summary

The UK has launched a combined MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) vaccination programme effective **1 January 2026** in England. This adds chickenpox protection to existing MMR coverage, representing a significant expansion of the routine childhood immunisation schedule.

## Vaccination Schedule

Children receive the MMRV vaccine at two key timepoints:
- **12 months of age** (first dose)
- **18 months of age** (second dose)

## Core Purpose

The programme "adds protection against chickenpox to the existing provision of protection against measles, mumps, and rubella," addressing a vaccine-preventable disease that previously was not part of the routine UK immunisation schedule.

## Key Resources for Healthcare Practitioners

1. **Main guidance document** — covers eligibility criteria, administration protocols, and safety information
2. **Appendix A** — eligibility tables in printable format for clinical reference
3. **Training slideset** — available for professional development and team education

## Recent Updates (February 2026)

The guidance has been refined to address:
- **Ibuprofen use** during vaccination
- **Managing immunisation** for children with ongoing close contact to pregnant women
- **Catch-up cohort eligibility** clarifications
- **IT system compatibility** issues
- **Vaccination protocols** for children with current infections

## Implementation Notes

- This guidance specifically applies to **England**
- Targets healthcare professionals administering the new routine immunisation programme
- Regular updates reflect real-world implementation challenges and clinical questions

## Public Health Significance

The addition of varicella to the routine immunisation schedule represents a major policy shift, potentially reducing chickenpox burden in children and complications in vulnerable populations. Integration into the existing MMR schedule as MMRV aims to maintain high coverage while expanding protection.
