## Summary

The UK government has launched a dedicated service to help users access educational materials about immunisation and public health programmes in England. The service provides free resources in multiple formats and languages, including accessible versions (audio, braille, British Sign Language, Easy Read, large print, simple text).

## Key Points

- **Purpose**: Support both general public and healthcare professionals with immunisation and public health education
- **Resource types**: Bulletins, consent forms, fridge magnets, GIFs, leaflets, posters, pull-up banners, slide sets, stickers, record cards, and videos
- **Accessibility**: Multiple formats and languages available, including specialized accessible formats
- **Professional benefits**: Healthcare workers can sign in with work emails for higher order limits and access materials to improve vaccine uptake, support informed consent, and reduce health inequalities
- **Health topics**: Primary focus on immunisation programmes and infectious diseases like influenza

## Access

Users can explore resources online without an account but must sign in to place orders. Alternative contact methods:
- Phone: 0300 123 1002 (Monday-Friday, 9am-5:30pm)
- Email: publichealthresources@ukhsa.gov.uk (3-5 working day response time)

## Public Health Significance

This centralized resource finder enhances access to evidence-based health communication materials, supporting consistent public health messaging across England and helping to address health inequalities through accessible, multilingual resources.

**Note**: The service was temporarily unavailable for maintenance on February 12, 2026.
