## 摘要

UKHSA detects the first case of clade Ib mpox in England and reminds eligible groups to come forward for mpox vaccination.

## 詳細內容

UKHSA reminds eligible groups to come forward for mpox vaccination following detection of the first case of clade Ib mpox in England. This represents a new strain variant entering the UK for the first time.

**Mpox clades explained:**
- **Clade I** (formerly Central African/Congo Basin): More severe disease, higher mortality
  - **Clade Ib**: Recently emerged subclade, associated with 2024 outbreaks in DRC and East Africa
- **Clade II** (formerly West African): Generally milder, associated with 2022 global outbreak

**Clade Ib significance:**
- **Higher severity**: More serious disease than clade II
- **Different transmission patterns**: May include heterosexual transmission networks
- **Geographic spread**: Recently spread from DRC to neighboring countries
- **WHO concern**: Declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in 2024

**Case detection:**
- First clade Ib mpox case identified in England
- Likely travel-associated (imported case)
- Contact tracing initiated
- Risk to general population remains low

**Mpox symptoms:**
- Rash (often starting on genitals, face, or extremities)
- Fever
- Swollen lymph nodes
- Headache, muscle aches, exhaustion
- Lesions progress through stages (macules → papules → vesicles → pustules → scabs)

**Vaccination program:**
- **Eligible groups**:
  - Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) at higher risk
  - Healthcare workers in specialist settings
  - Contacts of confirmed cases (post-exposure prophylaxis)
- **Vaccine**: Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-BN, Imvanex/Jynneos)
- **Schedule**: Two doses for optimal protection

**Public health message:**
UKHSA emphasizes that eligible individuals should not delay vaccination. While this clade Ib detection is significant for surveillance purposes, the vaccination program and public health measures remain effective against all mpox clades.

**Risk assessment:**
- General population risk remains low
- Higher-risk groups should ensure vaccination
- Anyone with unexplained rash and relevant exposure should seek medical attention
- Healthcare providers should maintain awareness for early detection
