- Death in severe cases

**Outbreak characteristics (typically included in such reports):**
- **Case count**: 293 laboratory-confirmed cases
- **Timeline**: May to November 2024 (6-month outbreak)
- **Source identification**: Food vehicle or environmental source
- **Geographic distribution**: Cases across multiple regions
- **Strain characterization**: Whole genome sequencing for outbreak linkage

**Investigation components:**
- **Epidemiological investigation**: Case interviews and exposure assessment
- **Microbiological analysis**: Strain typing and genetic analysis
- **Food chain investigation**: Tracing contaminated products
- **Environmental investigation**: Identifying contamination sources
- **Control measures**: Product recalls, hygiene advice, public alerts

**Public health response:**
- Rapid case finding and notification
- Coordination across multiple agencies (FSA, FSS, local authorities)
- Public health advice and warnings
- Industry engagement and product recalls
- Hospital management of severe cases

**Lessons learned:**
Outbreak reports typically identify:
- Response strengths and areas for improvement
- Surveillance and detection capabilities
