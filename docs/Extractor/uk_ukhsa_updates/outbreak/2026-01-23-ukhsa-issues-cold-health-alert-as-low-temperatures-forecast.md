## 詳細內容

UKHSA has issued a yellow Cold-Health Alert (CHA) for the North West and North East regions of England in response to forecasted low temperatures that pose health risks, particularly to vulnerable groups.

**Cold-Health Alert system:**
- **Yellow**: Minor impacts likely across health and social care services
- Geographic targeting based on weather forecasts
- Triggers preventive actions by health and care services
- Part of UKHSA's weather-health alerting system

**Health risks from cold weather:**
- **Cardiovascular events**: Heart attacks and strokes increase in cold weather
- **Respiratory infections**: Cold air exacerbates asthma and COPD
- **Falls and injuries**: Ice and snow-related accidents
- **Hypothermia**: Particularly in older adults
- **Exacerbation of chronic conditions**: Diabetes, arthritis, mental health

**Vulnerable populations:**
- People aged 65 and over
- Young children
- People with pre-existing health conditions
- People experiencing homelessness
- Socially isolated individuals
- Those in cold or poorly insulated homes

**Protective measures advised:**
- Keeping indoor temperatures at least 18°C
- Wearing warm clothing in layers
- Keeping active and moving regularly
- Ensuring hot food and drinks
- Checking on vulnerable neighbors and relatives
- Having prescription medications available

**Healthcare implications:**
Cold weather alerts enable health and social care services to:
- Prepare for increased demand
- Activate winter resilience plans
- Conduct welfare checks on vulnerable patients
- Ensure adequate staffing and resources

**Public health context:**
Winter pressures on healthcare services are substantially influenced by cold weather, which triggers both direct cold-related illness and exacerbation of chronic conditions. The alert system helps coordinate preventive action across health, social care, and voluntary sectors.
