## 摘要

UKHSA provides an update to previous advice regarding contaminated non-sterile alcohol-free wipes in response to continuing detection of cases and a recent death attributable to Burkholderia stabilis infection.

## 詳細內容

UKHSA are providing an update to previous advice regarding contaminated non-sterile alcohol-free wipes in response to continuing detection of cases and a recent death attributable to Burkholderia stabilis infection.

This represents an ongoing public health concern as these contaminated wipes continue to pose a serious risk to patients, particularly those who are immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions. The detection of additional cases and a recent fatality demonstrates the severity of this contamination issue.

Healthcare facilities and individuals are strongly advised to review their supplies and ensure they are not using the affected wipe products. Burkholderia stabilis is a gram-negative bacteria that can cause serious bloodstream infections, particularly when introduced through contaminated medical products.
