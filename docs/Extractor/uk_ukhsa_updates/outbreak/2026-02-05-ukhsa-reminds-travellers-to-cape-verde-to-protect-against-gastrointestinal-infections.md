## 摘要

UKHSA alerts UK travelers to Cape Verde about increased cases of Salmonella and other gastrointestinal infections, advising precautions to prevent illness.

## 詳細內容

In addition to general gastrointestinal infection risks, UKHSA has identified increases in cases of Salmonella associated with travel to Cape Verde. This travel health alert is issued to protect UK residents planning visits to the island nation.

**Key recommendations for travelers include:**
- Practicing good hand hygiene, especially before eating
- Avoiding undercooked or raw foods
- Drinking bottled or boiled water
- Being cautious with ice in drinks
- Washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly
- Seeking medical attention if symptoms develop

Salmonella infection typically causes:
- Diarrhea
- Fever
- Abdominal cramps
- Nausea and vomiting

Symptoms usually appear 6 to 72 hours after infection and most people recover without treatment, but severe cases may require medical care, especially in young children, elderly persons, and immunocompromised individuals.

Travelers returning from Cape Verde who develop gastrointestinal symptoms should inform their healthcare provider about their travel history to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
