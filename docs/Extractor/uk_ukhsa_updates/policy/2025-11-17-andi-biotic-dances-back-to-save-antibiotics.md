UKHSA's mascot Andi Biotic returns for World AMR Awareness Week with a creative campaign targeting young adults through gym partnerships and pharmacy disco events.

## 詳細內容

UKHSA's mascot returns for World AMR Awareness Week with a campaign targeting young adults, featuring gym partnerships and a pharmacy disco. This innovative public engagement approach aims to reach audiences not typically engaged with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) messaging.

**World AMR Awareness Week:**
- Annual global campaign (18-24 November 2025)
- Coordinated by WHO to raise awareness of antimicrobial resistance
- Multi-sectoral engagement across human health, animal health, and environment
- Theme: Educate, advocate, act now to prevent AMR

**Why target young adults:**
- **High antibiotic use**: Common for respiratory and urinary infections
- **Misconceptions**: May expect antibiotics for viral illnesses
- **Behavior formation**: Establishing appropriate antibiotic use patterns early
- **Future parents**: Will make decisions for children's antibiotic use
- **Peer influence**: Young adults can spread messages through social networks

**Campaign innovation:**
Traditional AMR messaging often fails to engage younger audiences. This campaign uses:
- **Gym partnerships**: Reaching health-conscious young adults where they are
- **Pharmacy disco**: Making pharmacies fun and approachable venues
- **Andi Biotic mascot**: Memorable, relatable character to embody key messages
- **Social media integration**: Shareable content and online engagement
- **Entertainment approach**: Education through enjoyment rather than fear

**Key AMR messages:**
- **Not all infections need antibiotics**: Viruses don't respond to antibiotics
- **Complete the course**: Finishing prescribed antibiotics prevents resistance
- **Never share antibiotics**: Prescriptions are personalized
- **Prevent infections**: Hygiene and vaccination reduce need for antibiotics
- **Talk to pharmacist**: Expert advice on when antibiotics are needed

**AMR crisis context:**
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to global health:
- 10 million deaths annually projected by 2050 if unchecked
- Common infections becoming untreatable
- Routine surgeries and cancer treatment at risk without effective antibiotics
- Disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations
- Economic burden of healthcare costs and productivity loss

**Behavior change needed:**
- Appropriate prescribing by healthcare providers
- Responsible use by patients
- Infection prevention and control in healthcare and community
- Agricultural stewardship (reducing antibiotic use in farming)
- Investment in new antibiotics and alternatives

**UK AMR strategy:**
The campaign supports UK's 20-year vision for containing and controlling AMR, which includes:
- Reducing antibiotic use by 15% from 2014 baseline
- Halving healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections
- Maintaining and strengthening surveillance
- Investing in innovation (new antibiotics, diagnostics, vaccines)

**Campaign evaluation:**
Success will be measured by:
- Reach and engagement metrics
- Knowledge and attitude changes
- Behavioral intentions regarding antibiotic use
- Pharmacy and GP consultation patterns

This creative approach demonstrates UKHSA's commitment to innovative public engagement, meeting people where they are with messages that resonate.
