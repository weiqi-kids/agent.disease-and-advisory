## 摘要

Government launches innovative scheme to reconnect thousands of people who have disengaged from HIV treatment, as part of a new action plan to improve testing and treatment access.

## 詳細內容

The government has launched a scheme that will see thousands of people benefit from improved HIV testing and treatment under a new action plan. This trailblazing initiative specifically targets people living with HIV who have become disengaged from care.

**The problem being addressed:**
- **Lost to follow-up**: People diagnosed with HIV but no longer attending clinic appointments
- **Treatment interruption**: Individuals who stopped taking antiretroviral therapy (ART)
- **Undiagnosed HIV**: People living with undetected HIV infection
- **Health inequalities**: Disproportionate impact on marginalized communities

**Why disengagement matters:**
- **Individual health**: Untreated HIV progresses to AIDS, causing serious illness and death
- **Viral suppression**: Effective treatment makes HIV undetectable and untransmittable (U=U)
- **Public health**: Undiagnosed or untreated HIV enables ongoing transmission
- **HIV elimination**: Reaching 95-95-95 targets (95% diagnosed, 95% on treatment, 95% virally suppressed)

**Scheme components likely include:**
- **Proactive outreach**: Tracing and contacting people lost to follow-up
- **Barrier reduction**: Addressing obstacles to care access
- **Peer support**: Using lived experience to reconnect people
- **Flexible services**: Community-based and non-traditional clinic models
- **Opt-out testing**: Expanding HIV testing in healthcare settings
- **Digital tools**: Using technology to improve engagement

**Populations targeted:**
- People diagnosed but never engaged in care
- Those who started treatment but stopped
- Priority groups with lower engagement (Black African communities, people who inject drugs, homeless populations)
- Areas with higher HIV prevalence

**UK context:**
The UK is close to achieving HIV elimination targets, with excellent outcomes for those engaged in care:
- Over 95% of people on treatment achieve undetectable viral load
- However, gaps remain in diagnosis and engagement
- Estimated 5,000+ people living with undiagnosed HIV in UK
- Re-engagement is critical to achieving elimination

**Evidence-based approach:**
The scheme builds on successful pilots and international evidence that targeted outreach and barrier reduction can successfully reconnect people with HIV care, improving both individual and public health outcomes.

This investment demonstrates government commitment to HIV elimination as a public health priority.
