## 摘要

Public-focused guide providing five practical actions individuals can take to combat antimicrobial resistance, as antibiotic-resistant infections reach nearly 400 new cases weekly in England.

## 詳細內容

Antibiotic-resistant infections are on the rise. Data published in autumn 2025 shows there are nearly 400 new cases reported every week in England. When bacteria adapt to survive antibiotics, vital medicines stop working when we need them most. But the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) isn't just for scientists and doctors - everyone can make a difference.

**The AMR crisis:**
- 400 new antibiotic-resistant infections weekly in England alone
- 10 million deaths annually projected by 2050 globally if unchecked
- Common infections becoming untreatable
- Routine surgeries at risk without effective antibiotics
- Major threat to modern medicine

**5 simple ways to help stop superbugs:**

**1. Only take antibiotics when prescribed**
- **Don't demand antibiotics**: Trust healthcare professionals' judgment
- **Viruses don't need antibiotics**: Colds, flu, most coughs and sore throats are viral
- **Antibiotics won't work faster**: Taking them unnecessarily drives resistance
- **Never save antibiotics**: Don't keep leftover antibiotics for later
- **Never share antibiotics**: Prescriptions are specific to individual and condition

**Why this matters:**
Every unnecessary antibiotic use gives bacteria opportunity to develop resistance. Using antibiotics only when truly needed preserves their effectiveness.

**2. Complete the course**
- **Finish all prescribed antibiotics**: Even if feeling better
- **Don't stop early**: Incomplete courses allow resistant bacteria to survive
- **Follow instructions**: Take at correct times and intervals
- **Store properly**: Keep in original packaging with instructions

**Why this matters:**
Stopping antibiotics early kills the weakest bacteria but allows stronger, potentially resistant bacteria to survive and multiply.

**3. Prevent infections in the first place**
- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing with soap and water (20 seconds)
- **Vaccination**: Stay up-to-date with all recommended vaccines
- **Food safety**: Proper cooking and storage prevents foodborne infections
- **Safe water**: Drink clean, safe water
- **Wound care**: Clean and cover cuts properly

**Why this matters:**
Preventing infections means fewer antibiotics needed. Vaccines prevent bacterial infections that would require antibiotic treatment.

**4. Practice good hygiene**
- **Wash hands frequently**: Before eating, after toilet, after coughing/sneezing
- **Cover coughs and sneezes**: Use tissue or elbow
- **Stay home when sick**: Prevent spreading infections
- **Clean surfaces**: Regular disinfection of high-touch areas
- **Don't share personal items**: Towels, razors, toothbrushes

**Why this matters:**
Good hygiene breaks chains of transmission, reducing infection spread and antibiotic use across the community.

**5. Ask your pharmacist**
- **Pharmacists are experts**: Free advice on minor ailments
- **Many conditions don't need antibiotics**: Pharmacists can recommend alternatives
- **Self-care advice**: How to manage symptoms while body fights infection
- **When to see GP**: Pharmacists help identify when medical care needed
- **Medication reviews**: Can identify antibiotic interactions or issues

**Why this matters:**
Pharmacists can resolve many health issues without antibiotics, preventing unnecessary use while ensuring people get help when needed.

**Additional actions:**
- **Educate others**: Share AMR awareness with family and friends
- **Support AMR campaigns**: World AMR Awareness Week and similar initiatives
- **Advocate for change**: Support policies addressing AMR
- **Responsible pet care**: Use antibiotics for pets only as prescribed by vet

**What happens if we don't act:**

**Individual level:**
- Your infections may become untreatable
- Longer illness, more complications
- Higher risk from routine procedures

**Society level:**
- Healthcare costs skyrocket
- Common infections become deadly again
- Modern medicine (surgery, chemotherapy, organ transplants) becomes too risky
- Return to pre-antibiotic era

**The good news:**
Everyone's actions matter. Each time someone:
- Accepts they don't need antibiotics
- Completes their antibiotic course
- Washes their hands
- Gets vaccinated

They help preserve these life-saving medicines for future generations.

**Important message:**
Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to global health, but it's not inevitable. Simple actions by millions of people add up to significant impact. By following these five steps, everyone can be part of the solution to keeping antibiotics working when we truly need them.

The fight against superbugs needs all of us. What will you do today?
