## 摘要

UKHSA announces a change of vaccine for the routine adult pneumococcal vaccination programme and individuals at increased clinical risk, providing updated guidance on the new vaccine product.

## 詳細內容

Information on the change of vaccine for the routine adult pneumococcal vaccination programme and individuals at increased clinical risk. This update reflects evolving evidence on pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness and serotype coverage.

**Pneumococcal vaccination program context:**
The UK offers pneumococcal vaccination to:
- All adults aged 65 and over
- Individuals at increased clinical risk (any age) due to:
  - Chronic respiratory disease (including asthma requiring inhaled steroids)
  - Chronic heart disease
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Chronic liver disease
  - Diabetes
  - Immunosuppression
  - Cochlear implants
  - CSF leaks
  - Asplenia or splenic dysfunction

**Reasons for vaccine change:**
- **Improved serotype coverage**: Newer vaccines cover more pneumococcal strains
- **Evolving epidemiology**: Changing patterns of circulating serotypes
- **Better protection**: Enhanced effectiveness based on clinical trials
- **Simplified schedules**: May reduce number of doses needed

**Implementation considerations:**
- Healthcare providers need updated guidance on which vaccine to use
- Patients partially vaccinated with previous product may need additional doses
- Stock management and supply chain coordination
- Public communication to ensure confidence in program

**Pneumococcal disease burden:**
- Leading cause of bacterial pneumonia
- Serious invasive disease (bacteremia, meningitis)
- Higher mortality in older adults and those with underlying conditions
- Antibiotic resistance makes prevention increasingly important

**Clinical significance:**
Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent pneumococcal disease. The vaccine change aims to maintain and improve protection as the epidemiology evolves and new vaccine technologies become available.

Healthcare providers should refer to the updated Green Book chapter and product-specific guidance for detailed information on the new vaccine, schedules, and transition arrangements.
