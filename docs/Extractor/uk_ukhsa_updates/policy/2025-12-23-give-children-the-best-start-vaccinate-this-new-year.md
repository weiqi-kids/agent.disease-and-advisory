## 摘要

UKHSA's festive season campaign urging parents to ensure children are up-to-date with vaccinations, describing immunization as one of the most important and life-saving gifts available for free.

## 詳細內容

This festive season, one of the most important and life-saving gifts you can give your child is vaccination, and it's completely free. UKHSA is using the New Year period to encourage parents to check their children's vaccination status and catch up on any missed doses.

**Routine childhood vaccinations protect against:**
- Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough)
- Polio
- Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)
- Hepatitis B
- Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
- Meningococcal disease
- Pneumococcal disease
- Rotavirus
- Human papillomavirus (HPV)
- Influenza (seasonal)

**Why vaccination matters:**
- **Life-saving protection**: Prevents serious diseases that can cause death or disability
- **Community immunity**: Protects those too young or unable to be vaccinated
- **Free and safe**: Provided by NHS at no cost, with extensive safety monitoring
- **Proven effectiveness**: Decades of evidence demonstrating benefits
- **School requirements**: Some vaccinations needed for certain activities

**New Year as opportunity:**
The festive period provides families time together and opportunity to:
- Check Red Book (child health record) for vaccination history
- Book any missed appointments
- Discuss concerns with healthcare providers
- Start the New Year with health protection updated

**Catch-up available:**
If children have missed doses, catch-up vaccination is available at any age. Parents should contact their GP practice to arrange appointments.

**Public health message:**
Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective and impactful public health interventions. Ensuring children are fully vaccinated provides the best start in life and protects both individual children and the wider community.
