## 摘要

The NHS childhood vaccination schedule has been updated from January 2026 to provide children with even better protection, including earlier protection against some diseases and new vaccines covering additional diseases.

## 詳細內容

The NHS childhood vaccination schedule has recently been updated to help give children even better protection against diseases. Changes include protecting children against some diseases earlier and adding vaccines that protect against more diseases.

**Major changes to the schedule:**

**1. Chickenpox (varicella) vaccination introduced:**
- **New addition**: MMRV vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella)
- **Replaces**: Previous MMR vaccine
- **Additional protection**: Now protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps, rubella
- **Schedule**: Same timing as previous MMR (12 months and 3 years 4 months)

**2. Earlier protection against some diseases:**
Timing adjustments to provide protection when children need it most, based on latest epidemiological evidence

**3. Updated vaccine formulations:**
Some vaccines updated to newer formulations with broader protection or improved safety profiles

**Rationale for changes:**

**Why add chickenpox vaccine?**
- **Disease burden**: Chickenpox causes significant illness in children
- **Complications**: Can lead to serious bacterial infections, pneumonia, encephalitis
- **Hospitalizations**: Prevents hundreds of hospitalizations annually
- **Deaths**: Prevents deaths from chickenpox complications
- **Shingles prevention**: May reduce future shingles burden
- **School absence**: Reduces time children miss from school
- **Parental burden**: Reduces need for parents to take time off work

**Evidence-based updates:**
All changes based on:
- Clinical trial data
- Real-world effectiveness evidence from other countries
- UK epidemiological data
- Safety monitoring
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommendations

**What parents need to know:**

**For children starting the schedule:**
- Will receive updated schedule automatically
- No action needed - GP practice will call when due
- Free through NHS

**For children already partially vaccinated:**
- May be offered catch-up doses
- GP practice will provide guidance
- Parents can check Red Book (child health record)

**Updated schedule (simplified overview):**
- 8 weeks: 6-in-1 vaccine + others
- 12 weeks: 6-in-1 + others
- 16 weeks: 6-in-1 + others
- 12 months: **MMRV** (new - includes chickenpox)
- 3 years 4 months: **MMRV** booster + 4-in-1 preschool booster
- (Additional vaccines at other ages as per full schedule)

**Safety:**
- All vaccines extensively tested before introduction
- Continuous safety monitoring after introduction
- UK has world-leading vaccine safety surveillance
- Benefits far outweigh very small risks

**Effectiveness:**
The updated schedule is expected to prevent:
- Thousands of chickenpox cases annually
- Hundreds of chickenpox-related hospitalizations
- Several deaths per year
- Substantial school and work absence
- Improved timing for other vaccines enhances protection

**Questions parents may have:**

**"Why wasn't chickenpox vaccine offered before?"**
- Evidence base has evolved
- Cost-effectiveness now demonstrated
- Manufacturing capacity now available
- Successful programs in other countries provide reassurance

**"Are more vaccines too many?"**
- No - children's immune systems can handle far more than the vaccines provide
- Combined vaccines reduce number of injections needed
- Spacing optimized for best immune response

**"What if my older child missed these?"**
- Catch-up programs may be available
- Speak to GP practice
- Protection still valuable even if delayed

**Important message:**
These changes represent the latest evidence-based improvements to one of the world's most successful vaccination programs. Ensuring children receive all recommended vaccines on schedule gives them the best possible protection against serious diseases. Parents should check their child's Red Book and keep appointments when called.
