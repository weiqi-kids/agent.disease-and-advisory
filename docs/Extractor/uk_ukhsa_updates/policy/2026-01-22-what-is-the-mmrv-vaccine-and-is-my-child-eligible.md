## 摘要

Comprehensive guide to the MMRV vaccine which replaced MMR in the routine childhood program from 1 January 2026, now protecting against four diseases including chickenpox.

## 詳細內容

This blog post was last checked and updated January 2026. Due to the introduction of a varicella (chickenpox) vaccination programme, the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine replaced the MMR vaccine in the routine childhood programme from 1 January 2026.

**What is MMRV vaccine?**
- **M**easles
- **M**umps
- **R**ubella (German measles)
- **V**aricella (chickenpox)

A combined vaccine protecting against four potentially serious viral diseases with a single injection.

**The four diseases:**

**1. Measles:**
- Highly contagious viral disease
- Causes fever, cough, rash
- Complications: Pneumonia, encephalitis, death
- 2024 saw 2,911 cases in England - highest in decades

**2. Mumps:**
- Viral infection causing swollen glands
- Can cause meningitis, encephalitis
- Rarely causes deafness or infertility
- Outbreaks still occur in under-vaccinated populations

**3. Rubella (German measles):**
- Usually mild in children
- **Serious risk in pregnancy**: Can cause congenital rubella syndrome (deafness, blindness, heart defects in unborn baby)
- Vaccinating children protects pregnant women through herd immunity

**4. Varicella (Chickenpox) - NEW:**
- Very contagious, causes itchy rash and blisters
- Usually mild but can have serious complications
- Complications: Secondary bacterial infections, pneumonia, encephalitis
- Higher risk in infants, adults, immunocompromised
- Can cause shingles later in life

**MMRV schedule:**
- **First dose**: 12 months old
- **Second dose**: 3 years 4 months old
- **Two doses**: Provides optimal protection against all four diseases
- **Free**: Provided by NHS at no cost

**Who is eligible?**

**Routine program (from 1 January 2026):**
- All children reaching 12 months on or after 1 January 2026
- All children due for preschool booster (3 years 4 months) on or after 1 January 2026

**What about children born before 2026?**
- Children already vaccinated with MMR: May be offered catch-up varicella vaccination separately
- Specific eligibility depends on age and previous vaccination status
- Parents should check with GP practice

**Effectiveness:**
After two doses:
- **Measles**: 99% protection
- **Mumps**: 88% protection
- **Rubella**: 99% protection
- **Varicella**: 95% protection (significantly reduces severe disease even when breakthrough occurs)

**Safety:**
- Extensively tested before introduction
- Used successfully in other countries (USA, Australia, Germany)
- Similar side effects to MMR:
  - Common: Mild fever, redness/swelling at injection site
  - Less common: Mild rash (measles-like or chickenpox-like)
  - Rare: Febrile seizure (usually harmless)
- Benefits far outweigh very small risks

**Why combined vaccine?**
- Fewer injections for children
- Better compliance (all protection in one visit)
- Proven safety of combination
- Cost-effective for NHS
- Successful model used for decades with other combined vaccines

**Chickenpox vaccination rationale:**
Adding varicella to routine schedule because:
- **Annual burden**: ~500,000 chickenpox cases in UK
- **Hospitalizations**: Hundreds annually, including deaths
- **Complications**: Serious bacterial infections (Group A Strep), pneumonia, encephalitis
- **Vulnerable populations**: Immunocompromised children at severe risk
- **Shingles prevention**: May reduce future shingles burden
- **Economic impact**: School absence, parental work loss

**Common questions:**

**"Won't natural chickenpox give better immunity?"**
- Vaccine provides excellent immunity without the risks of natural infection
- Natural infection can cause serious complications
- Vaccination safer than disease

**"Will this cause more shingles in adults?"**
- Research suggests no - may actually reduce shingles
- Shingles vaccine available for older adults

**"What if my child already had chickenpox?"**
- One dose may still be offered (provides boost)
- Discuss with healthcare provider
- No harm if vaccinated after natural infection

**"Can siblings catch vaccine virus?"**
- Very rare mild rash possible after vaccination
- Any rash should be covered
- Risk extremely low compared to natural infection

**Important message:**
The MMRV vaccine represents an important advancement in childhood disease prevention. By protecting against four serious diseases with excellent safety and effectiveness, it gives children the best possible start in life. Parents should ensure their children receive both doses on schedule. Those with questions should speak to their GP practice or health visitor.
