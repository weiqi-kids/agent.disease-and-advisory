## 摘要

UKHSA reports that a quarter of school-leavers remain unvaccinated against HPV, leaving young women at risk of cervical cancer and both sexes vulnerable to other HPV-related cancers.

## 詳細內容

A quarter of school-leavers are unvaccinated against HPV, leaving young women at risk of cervical cancer and both sexes vulnerable to other HPV-related cancers. This concerning finding highlights a significant gap in vaccine coverage despite the availability of free HPV vaccination through the school-based immunization program.

**HPV vaccination protects against:**
- **Cervical cancer**: Almost all cases are caused by HPV
- **Other cancers**: Vulval, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers
- **Genital warts**: Caused by HPV types 6 and 11

**Current program:**
- Offered to children aged 12-13 (school year 8)
- Two-dose schedule given 6-24 months apart
- Gender-neutral vaccination (boys and girls)
- Catch-up available for those who missed doses

**Implications of low coverage:**
- Individual risk of HPV-related cancers remains high
- Reduced herd immunity benefits
- Preventable cancers will continue to occur
- Need for enhanced catch-up efforts

**Barriers to vaccination:**
- Missed school-based vaccination opportunities
- Lack of awareness about catch-up availability
- Vaccine hesitancy
- Administrative challenges

UKHSA is urging parents and young people to check vaccination records and arrange catch-up doses if needed. HPV vaccination is one of the most effective cancer prevention measures available.
