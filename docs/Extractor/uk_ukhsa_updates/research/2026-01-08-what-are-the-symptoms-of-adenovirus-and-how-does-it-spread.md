## 摘要

Educational blog on adenovirus, one of the most common causes of viral infections, explaining that most people have at least one adenovirus infection before age 10.

## 詳細內容

Adenovirus might not be a household name like flu or the common cold, but it's one of the most common causes of viral infections. Most people will have had at least one adenovirus infection before they turn 10, and because there are many different types of adenovirus, people can be infected multiple times throughout their lives.

**What is adenovirus?**
- Large family of viruses (over 50 types affecting humans)
- Can infect different parts of the body
- Usually causes mild illness in healthy people
- Can cause more serious disease in young children, immunocompromised individuals
- Common year-round, with slight peaks in winter and spring

**Types of infections caused:**

**Respiratory infections (most common):**
- Common cold symptoms
- Bronchitis
- Pneumonia (in severe cases)
- Croup-like symptoms in young children

**Gastroenteritis:**
- Diarrhea and vomiting
- Common in young children
- Can lead to dehydration

**Eye infections:**
- Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
- Can be very contagious in group settings

**Other infections:**
- Bladder infections (rare)
- Neurological infections (very rare)

**Common symptoms by infection type:**

**Respiratory adenovirus:**
- Runny nose, sore throat
- Cough
- Fever
- Swollen lymph nodes
- Symptoms similar to common cold or flu

**Gastroenteritis adenovirus:**
- Diarrhea
- Vomiting
- Stomach pain
- Fever
- Usually lasts 1-2 weeks

**Adenoviral conjunctivitis:**
- Red, watery eyes
- Feeling like something in eye
- Light sensitivity
- Discharge from eyes
- Can affect one or both eyes

**How adenovirus spreads:**

**Respiratory transmission:**
- Droplets from coughing or sneezing
- Close personal contact
- Touching contaminated surfaces then touching face

**Fecal-oral transmission:**
- Poor hand hygiene after using toilet
- Changing diapers
- Contaminated food or water

**Contact transmission:**
- Touching contaminated surfaces
- Swimming pools (some types survive in chlorinated water)
- Shared towels or personal items

**Why so common in children:**
- Frequent close contact in childcare/school settings
- Developing hand hygiene skills
- No immunity to many adenovirus types yet
- Mouthing objects and toys

**Treatment:**
- No specific antiviral treatment
- **Supportive care**: Rest, fluids, fever reducers (paracetamol/ibuprofen)
- Most infections resolve on their own in 5-10 days
- Severe cases (particularly in immunocompromised) may need hospital care

**Prevention:**

**Key prevention measures:**
- **Frequent handwashing**: Most important prevention step
- **Avoid touching face**: Eyes, nose, mouth
- **Cover coughs/sneezes**: Tissue or elbow
- **Stay home when ill**: Prevent spread to others
- **Don't share personal items**: Towels, utensils, cups
- **Clean surfaces**: Regular disinfection of frequently touched surfaces
- **Avoid swimming pools when ill**: Especially with gastroenteritis

**When to seek medical care:**
- High fever not responding to medication
- Difficulty breathing
- Severe dehydration (no wet diapers for 8+ hours, very dry mouth)
- Symptoms lasting more than 10 days
- Severe headache or stiff neck
- Worsening symptoms after initial improvement

**Special considerations:**
- **Immunocompromised**: Higher risk of severe disease
- **Infants**: Higher risk of serious respiratory infection
- **Group settings**: Can spread rapidly in childcare, schools, hospitals

**Immunity:**
Infection with one type of adenovirus provides immunity to that specific type, but not to other types. This is why people can have multiple adenovirus infections throughout life.

**Important message:**
While adenovirus infections are very common and usually mild, practicing good hygiene significantly reduces transmission. Most children and adults recover fully without complications. Awareness of symptoms helps parents and caregivers provide appropriate care and know when medical attention is needed.
