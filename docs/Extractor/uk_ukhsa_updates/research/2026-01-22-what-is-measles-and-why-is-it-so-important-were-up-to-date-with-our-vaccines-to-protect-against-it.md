## 摘要

Educational blog on measles resurgence, explaining why maintaining high vaccine coverage is critical. In 2024, England recorded 2,911 laboratory confirmed cases - the highest annual count in decades.

## 詳細內容

Measles is highly contagious so even a small decline in vaccine uptake can lead to a rise in cases. There has been a resurgence of measles in England and around the world in recent years. In 2024 there were 2,911 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded annually in decades.

**What is measles?**
- Highly infectious viral disease caused by morbillivirus
- One of the most contagious diseases known (90% of non-immune contacts will catch it)
- Spreads through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing
- Virus can remain infectious in air for up to 2 hours
- People infectious from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears

**Symptoms:**
Initial phase (2-4 days):
- High fever
- Cough, runny nose, red eyes
- Koplik spots (white spots inside mouth)

Rash phase:
- Red-brown blotchy rash starting on face and spreading down body
- Fever may spike very high
- Feeling very unwell

**Complications (why measles is serious):**
Common:
- Ear infections (1 in 10 cases)
- Diarrhea and vomiting
- Eye infections

Serious:
- Pneumonia (most common cause of measles deaths)
- Encephalitis (brain inflammation, 1 in 1,000 cases)
- Death (1-2 per 1,000 cases in developed countries)
- Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) - rare fatal brain disorder years after infection

Higher risk in:
- Children under 5
- Adults over 20
- Pregnant women (risk of miscarriage, premature birth)
- Immunocompromised individuals

**Why the resurgence?**
- MMR vaccine coverage fallen below 95% needed for herd immunity
- Gaps in vaccination particularly in some communities and age cohorts
- COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine immunization services
- Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation
- International travel spreading measles from endemic areas

**2,911 cases in 2024 significance:**
- Highest annual count in decades represents major public health concern
- Indicates insufficient population immunity
- Clusters and outbreaks occurring in under-vaccinated communities
- Preventable disease causing serious illness when vaccination is available

**Vaccination (MMR vaccine):**
- **Schedule**: Dose 1 at 12 months, Dose 2 at 3 years 4 months
- **Effectiveness**: 99% effective with 2 doses
- **Safety**: Extensively studied, very safe
- **Catch-up**: Available at any age if previously missed
- **Free**: Provided by NHS at no cost

**Urgent message:**
Check your child's vaccination record (Red Book) and ensure they have both MMR doses. Adults born after 1970 who missed vaccination should catch up. Protecting against measles requires community action - high coverage protects those too young or unable to be vaccinated.

Measles is preventable. Vaccination works. The recent resurgence demonstrates what happens when coverage drops - preventable suffering occurs.
