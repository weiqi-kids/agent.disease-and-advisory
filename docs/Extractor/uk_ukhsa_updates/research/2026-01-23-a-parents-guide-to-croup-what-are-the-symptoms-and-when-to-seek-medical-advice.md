## 摘要

Parent-focused educational guide to croup, a common childhood respiratory condition, explaining symptoms and when to seek medical care.

## 詳細內容

Croup is a common childhood condition that affects the windpipe, the airways to the lungs, and the voice box. It mainly affects babies and young children, typically those aged between 6 months and 3 years, though most cases occur in 1-year-olds. Boys tend to be affected more than girls, and croup is most common during autumn and winter.

**What is croup?**
- Viral infection causing inflammation and swelling of the upper airway
- Affects the larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), and bronchi
- Narrows the airway, making breathing difficult
- Usually caused by parainfluenza viruses (other viruses can also cause croup)

**Characteristic symptoms:**
- **Barking cough**: Distinctive harsh, barking sound (like a seal)
- **Stridor**: High-pitched whistling sound when breathing in
- **Hoarse voice**: Due to vocal cord inflammation
- **Difficulty breathing**: More noticeable when child is upset or crying
- **Symptoms worse at night**: Often startles parents when child wakes with cough

**Typical progression:**
1. Starts with cold symptoms (runny nose, mild fever)
2. Barking cough and stridor develop, usually at night
3. Symptoms typically worst for 2-3 nights
4. Usually resolves within a week

**Home care for mild croup:**
- Keep child calm and comfortable (crying worsens symptoms)
- Give paracetamol or ibuprofen for fever and discomfort
- Offer fluids regularly
- Sit child upright
- Comfort and reassurance (anxiety worsens breathing difficulty)

**When to seek medical advice:**

**Call 999 or go to A&E if child:**
- Struggles to breathe (chest sucking in with each breath)
- Makes a grunting noise when breathing
- Is unusually quiet or still
- Has blue or grey skin or lips
- Is finding it hard to wake up or stay awake

**Contact GP or NHS 111 if child:**
- Symptoms are worsening
- Has a very high fever
- Is refusing to drink fluids
- You're worried about their breathing
- Has underlying health conditions

**Most children can be managed at home:**
About 95% of croup cases are mild and resolve without medical treatment. However, parents should remain vigilant as symptoms can worsen quickly.

**Prevention:**
- Good hand hygiene to prevent viral spread
- Keep child away from others when ill
- Ensure routine vaccinations are up to date (some vaccines prevent viruses that can cause croup)

**Reassurance for parents:**
Croup can be frightening, especially the barking cough and breathing sounds. However, most cases are mild. The distinctive symptoms help identify the condition, and knowing when to seek help empowers parents to manage safely at home while recognizing warning signs requiring medical attention.
