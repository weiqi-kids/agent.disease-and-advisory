## 摘要

UKHSA and Sleep Cycle launch innovative research study exploring how coughing and sleep-related signals from smartphone app data can support earlier detection of respiratory disease trends in the UK.

## 詳細內容

UKHSA and Sleep Cycle are launching a research study focusing on how coughing and sleep-related signals can support earlier detection of respiratory trends in the UK. This innovative approach represents a novel application of digital health data for public health surveillance.

**Research objectives:**
- Assess whether sleep app data can detect respiratory disease trends
- Evaluate cough detection as an early warning signal
- Compare app-based signals with traditional surveillance systems
- Explore real-time disease activity monitoring potential

**How it works:**
Sleep Cycle app users who opt-in will contribute anonymized data on:
- Coughing detected during sleep
- Sleep quality and duration
- Other sleep disturbances potentially related to illness
- Geographic location (aggregated for privacy)

**Potential benefits:**
- **Earlier outbreak detection**: Digital signals may appear before clinical diagnoses
- **Geographic granularity**: Localized disease activity monitoring
- **Real-time data**: Faster than traditional surveillance lag times
- **Large-scale participation**: Broad population coverage
- **Cost-effective**: Leverages existing technology infrastructure

**Privacy and ethics:**
- Fully anonymized data
- Opt-in participation only
- GDPR compliant
- No individual-level health tracking

**Syndromic surveillance innovation:**
This study builds on UKHSA's existing syndromic surveillance systems (NHS 111, GP consultations, emergency departments) by adding a novel data stream. If successful, sleep app data could complement traditional surveillance methods, particularly for:
- Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
- COVID-19 and emerging respiratory pathogens
- Seasonal respiratory illness patterns

**Research significance:**
This partnership demonstrates how digital health technologies can be harnessed for public health good, potentially transforming disease surveillance with earlier, more granular detection of respiratory disease trends.
