## 摘要

Educational blog explaining Nipah virus, a serious infectious disease causing periodic outbreaks in Asia, important for travelers to understand despite low overall risk. No UK cases have ever been found.

## 詳細內容

Nipah virus (NiV) is a serious infectious disease that periodically causes outbreaks in parts of Asia. While the risk to most people remains very low, understanding this virus is important if you are planning to travel to one of the areas where it circulates. No cases have ever been found in the UK.

**What is Nipah virus?**
- Zoonotic virus (transmitted from animals to humans)
- Henipavirus family
- First identified in 1999 during outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore
- High case-fatality rate (40-75% in outbreaks)
- No specific treatment or vaccine currently available

**Where is it found?**
Endemic areas:
- **Bangladesh**: Regular outbreaks, particularly in winter months
- **India**: Sporadic outbreaks, mainly in Kerala and West Bengal
- Other parts of South and Southeast Asia where fruit bats live

**Natural reservoir:**
Pteropus fruit bats (flying foxes) are the natural hosts, carrying virus without becoming ill.

**How does it spread?**

**Animal-to-human transmission:**
- Consuming date palm sap contaminated by infected bat urine or saliva
- Eating fruit partially eaten or contaminated by infected bats
- Direct contact with infected pigs (in early Malaysian outbreak)

**Human-to-human transmission:**
- Close contact with infected person's bodily fluids
- Particularly in healthcare settings without proper infection control
- Family members caring for sick relatives at high risk
- Transmission through respiratory droplets possible

**Symptoms:**
- Incubation: 4-14 days (can extend to 45 days)
- Initial: Fever, headache, muscle pain, vomiting, sore throat
- Progression: Dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness
- Severe: Encephalitis (brain inflammation), seizures, coma
- Some infections may be asymptomatic

**Prevention for travelers:**
- Avoid consuming raw date palm sap in endemic areas
- Do not eat fruit that may have been contaminated by bats
- Avoid contact with sick pigs or bats
- Practice good hand hygiene
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick
- Seek immediate medical care if symptoms develop after potential exposure

**Why awareness matters:**
Although UK risk is very low, awareness is important because:
- Returning travelers could import infection
- Healthcare workers need to recognize symptoms
- Early isolation prevents healthcare transmission
- Part of global outbreak preparedness

**WHO priority pathogen:**
Nipah virus is on WHO's priority list for research and development due to its pandemic potential and lack of medical countermeasures.
