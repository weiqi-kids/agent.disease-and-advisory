## 摘要

Research on the effectiveness of contact tracing strategies for detecting tuberculosis (TB) in people exposed to active TB cases in low-incidence countries like the UK.

## 詳細內容

This research publication examines the effectiveness of contact tracing strategies for detection of Tuberculosis (TB) in people exposed to a person with active TB in low TB incidence countries. The study is particularly relevant for the UK and similar settings.

**Context:**
Low TB incidence countries (< 10 cases per 100,000 population) face different challenges than high-burden settings:
- Most cases occur in specific risk groups
- Transmission events are less common
- Contact tracing plays a crucial role in early detection
- Preventing onward transmission is achievable

**Contact tracing strategies examined:**
- **Concentric circles approach**: Prioritizing close contacts first
- **Risk stratification**: Assessing individual exposure risk factors
- **Setting-based investigations**: Household, workplace, social contacts
- **Active case finding**: Screening high-risk contacts
- **Latent TB infection (LTBI) testing**: Preventing progression to active disease

**Key research findings typically include:**
- Yield of active TB cases among contacts
- Proportion with latent TB infection
- Cost-effectiveness of different strategies
- Optimal testing methods (tuberculin skin test vs. interferon-gamma release assays)
- Follow-up protocols and completion rates

**Implications for practice:**
- Evidence-based contact tracing protocols
- Resource allocation in TB control programs
- Balancing thoroughness with feasibility
- Integration with broader TB elimination strategies

**Relevance for UK:**
As a low-incidence country working toward TB elimination, effective contact tracing is a cornerstone of the UK's TB control strategy, particularly for preventing transmission in vulnerable populations.
