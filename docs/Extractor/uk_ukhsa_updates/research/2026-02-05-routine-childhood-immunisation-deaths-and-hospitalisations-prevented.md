## 摘要

Research publication estimating the annual deaths and hospitalisations prevented by routine childhood immunisation programs in England, demonstrating vaccine impact.

## 詳細內容

This research publication provides estimated annual deaths and hospitalisations prevented by routine childhood immunisation in England. The analysis quantifies the public health benefit of vaccination programs by modeling:

**Diseases prevented:**
- Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
- Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough)
- Polio
- Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)
- Meningococcal disease
- Pneumococcal disease
- Rotavirus
- Human papillomavirus (HPV)
- Others in the routine childhood schedule

**Impact metrics:**
- Deaths prevented annually
- Hospitalizations averted
- Cases avoided
- Healthcare costs saved
- Long-term disability prevented

**Methodology:**
The estimates are based on:
- Historical disease incidence before vaccine introduction
- Current vaccination coverage rates
- Vaccine effectiveness data
- Disease severity and case-fatality rates
- Demographic and epidemiological modeling

This evidence is crucial for:
- Demonstrating vaccine program value
- Supporting vaccination policy decisions
- Countering vaccine hesitancy with data
- Justifying public health investment in immunization
- International comparisons and best practice sharing

The research reinforces that childhood vaccination is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, preventing substantial morbidity and mortality each year.
