## 摘要

UKHSA reports nearly three-quarters of women who gave birth in September were vaccinated against whooping cough during pregnancy, providing vital early protection to newborn babies.

## 詳細內容

Nearly three-quarters of women who gave birth in September were vaccinated, helping to give their babies vital early protection against whooping cough (pertussis). This strong uptake demonstrates the success of the maternal pertussis vaccination program.

**Maternal pertussis vaccination program:**
- Offered to all pregnant women from 16 weeks gestation
- Optimal timing: 16-32 weeks to maximize antibody transfer
- Free through NHS antenatal care
- Each pregnancy requires vaccination (antibodies wane over time)

**Why vaccinate in pregnancy:**
- **Newborn vulnerability**: Babies cannot receive their own pertussis vaccine until 8 weeks old
- **Passive protection**: Maternal antibodies cross the placenta to protect newborns
- **Critical window**: First few months of life are highest risk for severe whooping cough
- **Proven effectiveness**: 90%+ reduction in infant whooping cough cases

**Whooping cough risks for infants:**
- Severe, prolonged coughing ("whooping" sound)
- Apnea (breathing stops)
- Pneumonia
- Seizures
- Brain damage
- Death (particularly in very young infants)

**73% coverage significance:**
While this represents good uptake, there remains room for improvement to reach the 75% national target and protect more babies. Every vaccinated mother means another infant protected during their most vulnerable weeks.

**Barriers addressed:**
- Misconceptions about vaccine safety in pregnancy
- Missed antenatal appointments
- Lack of awareness about program
- Access issues in some communities

**Public health impact:**
Since the maternal pertussis program began in 2012, there has been a dramatic reduction in infant whooping cough cases and deaths. The program is a key pillar of infant protection strategy, complementing the routine childhood immunization schedule.

UKHSA encourages all pregnant women to accept the whooping cough vaccine when offered during antenatal care to give their babies the best protection from birth.
