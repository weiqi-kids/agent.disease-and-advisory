## 摘要

UKHSA reports that TB notification rates in England have stabilized in 2025, while reminding the public to remain aware of TB symptoms for prompt testing and treatment.

## 詳細內容

UKHSA is reminding people to be aware of TB symptoms to help ensure prompt testing and treatment, following data showing that tuberculosis notifications in England stabilised in 2025.

**TB in England context:**
- Low-incidence country (< 10 cases per 100,000 population)
- Disproportionately affects certain populations (non-UK born individuals, urban areas)
- Stabilization follows years of declining rates
- Continued vigilance needed to achieve elimination goals

**Key TB symptoms to recognize:**
- Persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks
- Unexplained weight loss
- Night sweats
- Fever
- Fatigue
- Coughing up blood (in advanced cases)

**Why prompt diagnosis matters:**
- Earlier treatment improves outcomes
- Reduces risk of transmission to others
- Prevents disease progression
- Supports TB elimination efforts

**Populations at higher risk:**
- People born in high TB burden countries
- Close contacts of active TB cases
- Homeless individuals
- People with HIV or immunosuppression
- People with diabetes or other chronic conditions

**Public health message:**
UKHSA emphasizes that TB is curable with appropriate antibiotic treatment, typically lasting 6 months. Anyone with persistent cough or other TB symptoms should see their GP for assessment. Early diagnosis benefits both the individual and prevents further transmission.

The stabilization in notifications suggests that TB control efforts are being maintained, but continued awareness and testing are essential to progress toward elimination.
