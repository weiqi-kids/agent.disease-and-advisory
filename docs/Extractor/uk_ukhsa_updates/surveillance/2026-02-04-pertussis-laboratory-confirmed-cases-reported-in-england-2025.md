## 摘要

Enhanced surveillance data on laboratory confirmed pertussis (whooping cough) cases reported in England during 2025, tracking disease burden and trends.

## 詳細內容

This research publication presents laboratory confirmed cases of pertussis reported to the enhanced pertussis surveillance programme in England for 2025. Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis.

**Enhanced surveillance includes:**
- Laboratory confirmed case counts
- Age distribution of cases
- Geographic distribution across England
- Temporal trends and seasonal patterns
- Vaccination status of cases
- Severity and outcomes (hospitalizations, deaths)

**Clinical significance:**
Pertussis is particularly dangerous for:
- **Infants**: Highest risk of severe disease and death
- **Unvaccinated children**: Increased susceptibility
- **Adolescents and adults**: Often milder but can transmit to vulnerable infants

**Key surveillance findings typically include:**
- Cyclical patterns (3-5 year peaks)
- Impact of maternal vaccination program
- Vaccine effectiveness estimates
- Outbreak detection and response

**Public health importance:**
The surveillance data informs:
- Vaccination program effectiveness evaluation
- Need for booster doses
- Maternal vaccination program impact
- Early outbreak detection
- Public health messaging and interventions

Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis remains a public health challenge due to waning immunity and continued circulation. Enhanced surveillance is essential for monitoring trends and guiding control strategies.
