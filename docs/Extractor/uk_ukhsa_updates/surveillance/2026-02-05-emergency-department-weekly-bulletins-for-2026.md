## 摘要

Daily monitoring of emergency department attendance published weekly as part of syndromic surveillance, providing real-time indicators of acute illness and healthcare demand.

## 詳細內容

This research publication tracks the number of people attending emergency departments each day, with results published every week under the syndromic surveillance system. Emergency department (ED) surveillance is a critical component of public health monitoring because:

- **Rapid detection**: EDs often see the first cases of emerging outbreaks
- **Severity indicator**: ED attendance reflects more severe illness requiring urgent care
- **Real-time data**: Daily data collection enables rapid response to public health threats
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Captures both diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions

The surveillance system monitors syndromic indicators including:
- Respiratory symptoms
- Gastrointestinal illness
- Rashes and suspected infections
- Difficulty breathing
- Fever in children
- Other acute presentations

This data is essential for:
- Early outbreak detection
- Monitoring healthcare system pressure
- Assessing the impact of public health interventions
- Seasonal disease surveillance (flu, norovirus, etc.)
