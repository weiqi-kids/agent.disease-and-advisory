## 摘要

Weekly surveillance bulletins monitoring GP consultations during regular surgery hours as part of the syndromic surveillance system, tracking health-seeking behavior and disease patterns in primary care.

## 詳細內容

This research publication monitors the number of people who visit their GP during surgery hours under the syndromic surveillance system. The weekly bulletins provide valuable insights into:

- Primary care consultation patterns
- Symptom-based disease activity
- Early detection of unusual health trends
- Seasonal disease patterns
- Healthcare demand and capacity

GP in-hours surveillance complements other syndromic surveillance systems (NHS 111, emergency departments, out-of-hours services) to provide a comprehensive picture of disease activity in the community. By analyzing consultation data in real-time, public health officials can detect emerging threats before laboratory confirmation is available.

The data helps identify:
- Respiratory illness trends
- Gastrointestinal disease activity
- Influenza-like illness patterns
- Other acute conditions requiring public health attention
