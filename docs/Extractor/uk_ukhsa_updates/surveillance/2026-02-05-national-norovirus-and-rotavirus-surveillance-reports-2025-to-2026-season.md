## 摘要

National surveillance reports tracking norovirus and rotavirus laboratory confirmations and enteric virus outbreaks in hospital settings across England for the 2025 to 2026 season.

## 詳細內容

This official statistics publication presents comprehensive surveillance data for norovirus and rotavirus during the 2025 to 2026 season in England. The reports cover:

**Laboratory surveillance:**
- Confirmed norovirus cases by strain and genotype
- Rotavirus detections and strain distribution
- Temporal trends and seasonal patterns
- Age distribution of cases

**Outbreak surveillance:**
- Enteric virus outbreaks in hospital settings
- Outbreak size and attack rates
- Settings affected (wards, departments)
- Control measures implemented

**Norovirus** is the most common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings, causing:
- Vomiting and diarrhea
- Rapid person-to-person spread
- Significant disruption to healthcare services
- Ward closures and infection control challenges

**Rotavirus** primarily affects children, though routine vaccination has substantially reduced disease burden in the UK.

This surveillance is essential for:
- Early outbreak detection in healthcare facilities
- Monitoring vaccine effectiveness (rotavirus)
- Guiding infection prevention and control strategies
- Understanding seasonal disease patterns
