## 摘要

Weekly surveillance bulletins tracking NHS 111 call volumes in England, providing real-time indicators of health-seeking behavior and potential disease outbreaks through syndromic surveillance.

## 詳細內容

This research publication presents weekly bulletins summarizing the number of people calling NHS 111 for health advice within England. The data is collected and analyzed as part of the syndromic surveillance system, which provides early warning signals for:

- Emerging infectious disease outbreaks
- Seasonal disease patterns
- Public health events requiring rapid response
- Healthcare system demand and capacity planning

NHS 111 call data serves as a valuable indicator of population health status and disease activity. By monitoring patterns in call volumes and symptoms reported, public health officials can detect unusual disease activity before cases are confirmed through laboratory testing. This enables faster public health responses and better resource allocation.

## 相關疾病

Multiple conditions monitored through syndromic surveillance including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal illnesses, and other acute health conditions
