## 摘要

Weekly surveillance report comparing actual deaths in England with expected numbers, providing essential data for monitoring population health and excess mortality patterns.

## 詳細內容

This official statistics publication presents weekly all-cause mortality surveillance data for England for the 2025 to 2026 season. The report compares the actual number of deaths occurring each week with the expected numbers of deaths, calculated using historical data and statistical models.

This surveillance system is crucial for:
- Detecting unusual patterns in mortality
- Monitoring the impact of seasonal factors (e.g., winter pressures, heatwaves)
- Assessing the burden of infectious disease outbreaks
- Evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions

The data is updated weekly and provides an important early warning system for public health emergencies.
