# Pneumococcal disease: cases caused by serotypes not covered by PCV13

**Source**: [UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pneumococcal-disease-caused-by-strains-not-covered-by-prevenar-13-vaccine)
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Category**: Surveillance
**Feed**: ukhsa_official

## Summary

The UK Health Security Agency monitors invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases caused by serotypes excluded from the PCV13 vaccine. This surveillance document provides cumulative weekly reports tracking these infections across England from July 2017 through September (week 39) 2025, with the most recent update released February 10, 2026.

## Surveillance Scope

**Age groups monitored**:
- Children under 2 years
- Children aged 2 to 4 years
- Adults aged 5 to 64 years
- Adults aged 65 years and over

**Time period**: July 2017 to September 2025 (week 39)

## Data Structure

The publication contains 4 graphs showing cumulative weekly reports of IPD caused by serotypes not included in Prevenar 13™ vaccine, segmented by the four age groups listed above.

## Public Health Significance

Tracking serotypes outside PCV13 coverage is critical for:
- Identifying potential vaccine gaps
- Monitoring disease patterns in post-vaccination populations
- Detecting emerging pneumococcal threats
- Informing future vaccine policy decisions

Regular updates (most recent in February 2026) demonstrate ongoing surveillance commitment to monitor the evolving pneumococcal disease landscape and assess whether current vaccination strategies adequately protect the population.

## Technical Note

The webpage contains metadata describing the document structure. Specific epidemiological trends, case numbers, and detailed findings are contained in the accompanying graphs within the full HTML document.
