# Pneumococcal disease: cases caused by serotypes covered by PCV13

**Source**: [UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pneumococcal-disease-cases-caused-by-strains-covered-by-prevenar-13-vaccine)
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Category**: Surveillance
**Feed**: ukhsa_official

## Summary

The UK Health Security Agency publishes cumulative weekly surveillance data on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by serotypes covered by the PCV13 (Prevenar 13™) vaccine. This surveillance tracks vaccine-targeted infections across England from July 2017 through September (week 39) 2025, with the most recent update released February 10, 2026.

## Surveillance Parameters

**Geographic scope**: England only

**Time period**: July 2017 to September 2025 (week 39)

**Age groups monitored**:
- Children under 2 years
- Children aged 2 to 4 years
- Adults aged 5 to 64 years
- Adults aged 65 years and over

## Data Structure

The publication contains 4 graphs showing cumulative weekly reports of IPD infections caused by serotypes included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, broken down by the four age groups.

## Public Health Significance

This surveillance is critical for:
- **Vaccine effectiveness assessment**: Monitoring whether PCV13 successfully reduces disease caused by targeted serotypes
- **Population protection evaluation**: Tracking IPD trends in both vaccinated and unvaccinated age groups
- **Herd immunity analysis**: Detecting indirect protection in older adults not routinely vaccinated
- **Policy validation**: Confirming pneumococcal vaccination strategy continues to meet public health objectives

## Complementary Surveillance

This dataset complements the parallel surveillance of non-PCV13 serotypes, providing a complete picture of the pneumococcal disease landscape and helping identify serotype replacement patterns.

## Technical Note

The webpage functions as a data repository with regular updates (most recently February 10, 2026). Specific epidemiological findings, trend patterns, and vaccine effectiveness conclusions are contained in the referenced HTML document containing the four epidemiological graphs.
