## 摘要

Among 3,171 nonhospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, 69% had one or more outpatient visits 28-180 days after the diagnosis. Two thirds had a visit for a new primary diagnosis, and approximately one third had a new specialist visit. Symptoms potentially related to COVID-19 were common new visit diagnoses. Visits for these symptoms decreased after 60 days but for some patients continued through 120-180 days.
