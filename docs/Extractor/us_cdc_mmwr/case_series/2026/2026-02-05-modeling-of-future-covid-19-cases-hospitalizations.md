Data from six models indicate that with high vaccination coverage and moderate nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) adherence, hospitalizations and deaths will likely remain low nationally, with a sharp decline in cases projected by July 2021. Lower NPI adherence could lead to substantial increases in severe COVID-19 outcomes, even with improved vaccination coverage
