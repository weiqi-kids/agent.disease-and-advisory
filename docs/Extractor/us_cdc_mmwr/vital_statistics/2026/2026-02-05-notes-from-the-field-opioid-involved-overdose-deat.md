## 摘要

The declines in overdose deaths with fentanyl analogs (carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, acrylfentanyl, and cyclopropylfentanyl) detected contributed to declines in opioid-involved overdose deaths during 2018 among a subset of states, even as deaths with fentanyl detected increased over time, which highlights the continued need to test for fentanyl analogs.
