## 旅遊建議

**Level 1 - Practice Usual Precautions**: Travelers on safari in Zambia and Zimbabwe should:
- Avoid tsetse fly bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants in neutral colors (avoid bright or dark colors which attract flies)
- Use EPA-registered insect repellents on exposed skin
- Inspect vehicles before entering to ensure no tsetse flies are inside
- Avoid areas with high tsetse fly activity, particularly woodland and savannah areas
- Seek medical attention if you develop fever, headaches, joint pain, or itching after a fly bite
- Be aware that symptoms may not appear until weeks or months after exposure
