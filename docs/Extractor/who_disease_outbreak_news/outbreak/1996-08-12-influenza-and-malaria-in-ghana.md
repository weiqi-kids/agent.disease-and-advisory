Disease Outbreak Reported

In response to media reports of an outbreak of influenza the Ministry of Health of Ghana issued a press release 30 July concerning the "apparent" high level of febrile illnesses, general malaise, headache, body pain, and unproductive cough among the general population. The press release informs that most cases are malaria and acute upper respiratory tract infection of viral origin according to preliminary investigations. The viral infection usually lasts for a few days and is usually not associated with serious illness. Most cases need only palliative treatment for pain and cough. Antibiotics are not required.

Cases of malaria are not uncommon during this time of the year when the rains, heat and humidity provide the ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. Most cases respond favourably to chloroquine treatment when administered properly.
