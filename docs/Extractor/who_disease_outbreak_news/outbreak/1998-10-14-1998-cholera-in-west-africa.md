## 摘要

## 詳細內容

14 October 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported There has been a recrudescence of cholera in the West Africa region since September 1998. Some countries in the region have been reporting cases of cholera since the beginning of the year. As from September, however, there has been a considerable increase in the number of countries reporting from the region and in the number of cases. Eleven countries are currently reporting cases of cholera with, for the time being, a relatively acceptable case fatality rate. The ministries of health of the countries affected are taking steps to ensure adequate case management and prevent further spread. These measures have been quite successful so far. WHO is concerned about the potential deterioration of the situation in the region and therefore strongly recommends the strengthening of epidemic preparedness and response activities for the countries in West Africa. The region was ravaged by a dramatic cholera epidemic in 1994-95. In 1995, West Africa represented 64% of all cholera cases and 67% of all cholera deaths reported in Africa.
