## 詳細內容

25 November 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported According to data from the National Centre for Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health in Brazil, 376 cases of cholera have been notified between 12 and 23 November 1998, 24 of which have been laboratory-confirmed. The cases are occurring in the urban area of Cortez municipality (which has a population of approximately 13 000) in the region of Mata-Sul, Pernambuco State, in north-eastern Brazil. The source of contamination is thought to be the Rio Sirinhaém, from which 80% of the water used by the population originates. The Health Department, in collaboration with water and sanitation authorities from the State of Pernambuco are coordinating epidemiological surveillance, health education activities, water chlorination and case management. The medical team will be reinforced with professionals from other States. Supplies for the treatment of patients are in place and the central laboratory is active in the area. Suspected cases have been notified in neighbouring areas, but without confirmation. This cholera outbreak is the first to be reported in Brazil in l998.
