## 詳細內容

28 December 2001

Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 27 December, 29 confirmed cases (12 laboratory and 17 epidemiologically linked), including 20 deaths, have been reported. An additional 8 suspected cases are under investigation in Gabon. All contacts (having direct or suspected contact with the blood or other body fluids of a case) are being closely monitored for signs or symptoms of Ebola haemorrhagic fever for 21 days. Currently, 206 contacts are under active follow up. We anticipate one or more cases may develop among these contacts.

Of the 29 cases, 17 were detected in Gabon and 12 in the neighbouring villages of the Republic of the Congo. As of 27 December, 91 contacts are being followed up in Gabon and 115 in the Republic of the Congo. The international team is operational on both sides of the border and is working closely in the field with the teams from the Congolese and Gabonese Ministries of Health on outbreak control interventions.
