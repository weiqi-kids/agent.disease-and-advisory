## 摘要

6 June 2005 On 6 June 2005, four new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia, bringing the total number of cases to 20.



## 詳細內容

6 June 2005 On 6 June 2005, four new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia, bringing the total number of cases to 20. One of the four new cases is from the same district as the index case (Sukabumi district), and three are from neighbouring districts (Lebak and Cianjur districts). On 2 May 2005, the global reference laboratory in Mumbai, India, confirmed a wild poliovirus type 1 isolate, from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case identified by the national surveillance system in Giri Jaya village, Sukabumi District, West Java, Indonesia. The case, an 18-month old child who was previously un-immunized, had onset of paralysis on 13 March 2005. From 31 May to 2 June, a polio immunization 'mop-up' campaign was conducted, covering West Java, Banten and Jakarta provinces, to reach 6.4 million children under the age of five years. Planning for the second round campaign (to be held on 28-29 June) has begun. The findings of the investigation suggest a recent introduction of wild poliovirus. The genetic analysis of the virus demonstrates that its origin is in west Africa, similar to the viruses which caused the 2003/04 outbreak. Further analysis suggests the virus traveled to Indonesia through Sudan, and is similar to recently isolated viruses in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Indonesia has not had a wild poliovirus case since 1995. For more information Indonesia: update on polio outbreak (6 June) (pdf) Polio Eradication Initiative
