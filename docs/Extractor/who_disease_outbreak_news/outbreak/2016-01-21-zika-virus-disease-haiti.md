## 詳細內容

On 18 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Haiti notified PAHO/WHO of 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus infection. Of the 5 confirmed cases, 4 are from the Delmas commune while the remaining case is from the P&eacute;tion-Ville commune. Samples of the patient were sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) laboratory in Trinidad and Tobago for testing. All cases were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR).In addition, between 4 and 12 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Germany notified PAHO/WHO of 2 cases of Zika virus infection in German nationals who had returned from Haiti to Germany in late December. Samples from both patients were collected and sent for laboratory testing to the national reference centre for tropical diseases in Germany. While one of the cases was confirmed by both RT-PCR and serology, the other was confirmed only by serology.
