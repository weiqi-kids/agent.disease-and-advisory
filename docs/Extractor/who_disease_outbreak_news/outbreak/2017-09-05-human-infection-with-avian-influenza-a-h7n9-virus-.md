He developed symptoms on 19 July 2017, and was admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia on 29 July 2017. He was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. The Chinese government has assessed that it is still likely that sporadic cases will occur in China, taking into consideration the previous epidemic situation and risk assessment.
