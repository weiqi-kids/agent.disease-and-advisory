The case is a 19-year-old female from Pasabe Sub-Region, Oecusse, formally known as the Special Administrative Region of Oe-C&uacute;sse Ambeno (RAEOA - Portuguese acronym). The case was confirmed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCT) at the National Health Laboratory in Timor-Leste on 22 March from a saliva sample taken prior to the individual&rsquo;s death.On 20 March, the patient presented to a local health center with symptoms including high fever, vomiting, sore throat, cough, difficulty swallowing food, hydrophobia, photophobia, back pain, and neck stiffness. It was reported that she was bitten on the hands by a dog on 26 December 2023 in Oecusse. During the investigation, residents described the dog as very aggressive, and reported that it had not bitten anyone else. The dog died and was buried on 27 December 2023. The patient had not received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after the dog bite. On 21 March, she was transferred to Guido Valadares National Hospital (HNGV) in the capital city of Dili and died on 22 March 2024.As of 24 April 2024, a total of 95 exposures to dogs have been reported in Oecusse Municipality.

Out of the 95 individuals who were exposed to dogs, seven were bitten by dogs that were confirmed to have rabies. Among these cases, two individuals have completed their post-exposure prophylaxis vaccinations (as of 24 April 2024).
