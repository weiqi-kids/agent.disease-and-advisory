## 摘要

As of 10 October 2024, a total of 58 cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD), including 13 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 22%), have been reported in Rwanda. Fifteen recoveries have been reported among the confirmed cases as of 10 October 2024. Contact tracing is underway, with over 700 contacts under follow-up as of 9 October 2024. 

WHO classified the outbreak as a grade 3 emergency, the highest internal level for emergencies based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework and a surge team from WHO has travelled to support the in-country response across the functions of incident management: epidemiology, health operations, case management, health logistics, vaccines research, partner coordination and infection prevention and control. 



## 詳細內容

Since the first Disease Outbreak News on this event was published on 30 September 2024, 32 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD)have been reported in Rwanda. As of 10 October 2024, a total of 58 cases, including 13 deaths (CFR: 22%), have been reported. The vast majority of the cases have been reported from the three districts within Kigali. Since the declaration of the outbreak on 27 September and as of 10 October, 15 confirmed cases have recovered, the remaining 30 cases are under care at the designated Marburg treatment center. Health workers from two health facilities in Kigali account for over 80% of confirmed cases. All new confirmed cases reported within the past week, have been associated with the two hospital clusters in Kigali. As of 10 October 2024, a total of 2949 tests for Marburg virus have been conducted, with approximately 200-300 samples being tested daily at the Rwanda Biomedical Center from suspected MVD cases. Contact tracing is underway, with over 700 contacts under follow-up as of 9 October 2024. A contact is known to have travelled internationally, to Germany, and is currently being monitored by the local health authorities for the recommended 21 days follow-up period. A contact who travelled to Belgium has completed the 21 days follow-up period and no longer poses a public health risk. The source of the outbreak is still under investigation and additional information will be provided when available.
