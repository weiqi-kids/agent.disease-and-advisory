## 詳細內容

22 October 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported As of October 1998 a total of 32 confirmed cases with 13 deaths have been reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO. Twenty-three cases (72%) were male and 9 (18%) female. The age distribution of the cases was: 35% over 30 years of age; 35% 20 to 30 years; and 30% 10 to 19 years. Twenty-two cases were not vaccinated, two had received vaccine, and the status of 8 was unknown. 7 new cases have been notified. Two cases occurred in Pará State (Itaituba and Floresta Municipalities) and 5 in Roraima State (Alto Alegre and Mucajaí Municipalities). At least two of the Roraima cases became sick in Boa Vista, the State Capital, which is infested by Aedes aegypti. The threat of urbanization of yellow fever in Roraima led the national and local authorities to immediately start vaccination of the entire population of the State (260,000 inhabitants). Since 1996, Yellow Fever Vaccine has been included in routine child immunization of the enzootic areas of Brazil. In 1999 the Ministry of Health is planning to immunize 110 million people living in enzootic areas and contiguous regions infested by Ae. aegypti.
