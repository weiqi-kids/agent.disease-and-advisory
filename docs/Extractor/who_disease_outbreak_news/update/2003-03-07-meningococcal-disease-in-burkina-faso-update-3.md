## 詳細內容

7 March 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported As of 6 March, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso has reported a total of 3 691 cases, including 542 deaths in the country since the outbreak began in January 2003 (see previous report). Of the 53 districts in Burkina Faso, 5 districts have reached the epidemic threshold: Batie, Bogande, Manga, Po and Zabre and 8 districts are in the alert phase: Boulsa, Bousse, Dande, Leo, Nanoro, Sapone, Secteur 30 de Ouagadougou, and Zorgho. A mass vaccination campaign in Manga and Bogande is continuing. A team from the Ministry of Health and WHO have carried out an assessment mission to those districts having reached the epidemic threshold and have developed action plans to contain the outbreaks in these areas. Laboratory tests from samples in these districts confirm Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A and W135.
