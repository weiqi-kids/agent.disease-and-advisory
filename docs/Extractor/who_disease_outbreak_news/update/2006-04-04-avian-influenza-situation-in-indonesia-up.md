The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 20-month-old girl who resided in Kapuk, West Jakarta. She developed symptoms of fever and cough on 17 March, was hospitalized on 22 March, and died on 23 March.

Field investigation found a history of deaths in a chicken flock near her home about one week prior to symptom onset. Chicken deaths in the neighbourhood have continued, but the cause has not yet been identified. Family members and neighbours have been placed under observation and samples from these people have been taken for testing. Preliminary results are negative, but follow-up investigation is continuing.
