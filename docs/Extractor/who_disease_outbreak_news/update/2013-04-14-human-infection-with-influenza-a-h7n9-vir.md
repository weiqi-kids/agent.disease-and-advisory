## 摘要

中國國家衛生和計劃生育委員會通報WHO河南省新增兩例實驗室確診的H7N9人類感染病例。截至2013年4月14日,中國共計51例實驗室確診病例,包括11例死亡。

## 詳細內容

14 April 2013 -

As of 14 April 2013 (18:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus from Henan.

The first patient is a 34-year-old man who became ill on 6 April 2013, and the second patient is a 65-year-old man who became ill on 8 April 2013.

To date, a total of 51 patients have been laboratory-confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China; including 11 deaths. More than a thousand close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored.

Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

### About this Disease Outbreak News

1. WHO is currently publishing information on laboratory confirmed cases received through the official notification from the Chinese National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point once a day. This formal notification and publication follows verification of the information, and may therefore come after, or not include, some cases reported through public media and other sources.

2. To date, there is limited information to determine whether the reported number of cases represents some or all of the cases actually occurring. As some relatively mild cases of illness have now been reported, it is possible that there are other such cases that have not been identified and reported.

3. If the current pattern of sporadic infections continues, WHO will cease frequent reporting of case numbers, and focus its Disease Outbreak News on new developments or changes in the pattern or presentation of infections.
