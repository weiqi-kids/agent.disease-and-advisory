## 詳細內容

7 May 2013 - As of 7 May 2013 (11:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The first patient is a 69-year-old man from Fujian province who became ill on 29 April 2013 and the second patient is a 9-year-old boy, also from Fujian province, who became ill on 26 April 2013. Additionally five patients earlier reported have died. To date, a total of 130 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 31 deaths have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.
