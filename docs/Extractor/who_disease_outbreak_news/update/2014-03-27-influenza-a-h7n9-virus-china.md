## 摘要

中國國家衛生和計劃生育委員會在2014年3月20日至25日期間,向WHO通報6例H7N9禽流感人類感染新增實驗室確診病例。

## 詳細內容

Between 20 and 25 March 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of six additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

### Details of the case reported on 20 March are as follows:

- A 78 year-old man living in Shaoyang City, Hunan Province. He became ill on 12 March, was admitted to a hospital on 18 March and is currently in a severe condition.

### Details of the case reported on 21 March are as follows:

- A 32 year-old man living in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province. He became ill on 18 March, was admitted to a hospital on 21 March and is currently in a severe condition.

### Details of the cases reported on 24 March are as follows:

- An 82 year-old man from Chuzhou City, Anhui Province. He became ill on 10 March and was admitted to hospital the same day. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to poultry.

- A 62 year-old man from Shantou City, Guangdong Province. He became ill on 14 March and was admitted to hospital on 19 March. He is currently in a critical condition.

### Details of the cases reported on 25 March are as follows:

- A 49 year-old man from Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province. He became ill on 15 March, was admitted to a hospital on 23 March and is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to poultry.

- A 58 year-old man from Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province. He became ill on 12 March, was admitted to a hospital on 19 March and is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to poultry.

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:

- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment; and
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information.

### Sporadic human cases

The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').

The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.

Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.
