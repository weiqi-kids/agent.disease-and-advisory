## Action Recommendations
{: .actionable-steps }

Based on this week's epidemic developments, the following actions are recommended:

### Vaccination Recommendations

| Target Population | Recommended Vaccine | Priority |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Travelers to measles-endemic areas | MMR vaccine (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) | 🔴 High |
| Pregnant women (to protect infants) | RSV vaccine, Tdap vaccine (pertussis) | 🟡 Medium |
| Adults aged 75+ | RSV vaccine, Influenza vaccine | 🟡 Medium |
| Children aged 1+ | MMR vaccine (verify vaccination record) | 🟡 Medium |

### Preventive Measures

- **Cold weather**: Adults aged 65+ and cardiovascular disease patients should stay warm and avoid prolonged exposure to cold temperatures
- **Food safety**: Ensure meat is thoroughly cooked, avoid raw food to reduce antimicrobial-resistant bacteria infection risk
- **Hand hygiene**: Wash hands frequently, especially before and after handling food

### Travel Alerts

| Destination | Alert Level | Risk | Recommendation |
|-------------|-------------|------|----------------|
| West Bengal, India | 🔴 High Risk | Nipah virus | Avoid non-essential travel |
| Vietnam, Japan | 🟡 Medium Risk | Measles | Verify MMR vaccination status |
| China, Cambodia | 🟡 Medium Risk | Avian influenza H5N1 | Avoid contact with live poultry |

## Comparison with Last Week

### New Threats

- **UKHSA First Cold Mortality Report (UK)**: UKHSA published England's first annual cold mortality monitoring report on 2/18. During winter 2024-25, 2,544 deaths were associated with three cold wave events. The report reveals the hidden health impacts of cold weather - primarily through indirect pathways such as heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory problems rather than direct hypothermia. High-risk groups include adults aged 65+, cardiovascular and respiratory disease patients, and dementia patients.

- **Foodborne Bacteria Antimicrobial Resistance Warning (Europe)**: ECDC and EFSA published a joint report on 2/18, indicating that ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter remains persistently high, with ciprofloxacin no longer recommended for Campylobacter infections. More concerning is the rising detection of carbapenemase-producing E. coli in food-producing animals and meat - carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics for humans.

- **HCID National Risk List Update (UK)**: UKHSA updated the global High Consequence Infectious Disease risk list on 2/18, covering multiple pathogens including Ebola, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and avian influenza. The list specifically notes the Nipah virus outbreak confirmed in Barasat, West Bengal, India on January 13, 2026.

- **RSV Vaccine PGD Template (UK)**: UKHSA published the RSV vaccine Patient Group Direction template on 2/17, providing standardized vaccination guidance for healthcare practitioners, supporting the national vaccination programme for pregnant women and adults aged 75+. This is an important guidance document for the RSV vaccine programme.

- **ECDC and PHAC International Cooperation**: On 2/16, the Public Health Agency of Canada President visited ECDC, reflecting continued deepening of transatlantic public health cooperation, enhancing coordinated response capabilities to cross-border public health threats.

### Escalated Alerts

- **Childhood Vaccination Campaign (UK)**:
  - UKHSA launched a new childhood vaccination promotion campaign (2/16)
  - Published MMR vaccine Easy Read guide (2/16)
  - Reflects ongoing efforts by authorities to maintain high vaccination coverage rates, particularly following vaccine hesitancy in some areas post-pandemic

### Continued Monitoring

- **Measles**: 400 contacts of Taiwan's first imported case (from Vietnam) continue monitoring until February 28. Global measles situation remains serious with 7,655 cases in Europe in 2025, 80% unvaccinated.

- **Pertussis (Whooping Cough)**: Household contacts of Taiwan's first pertussis case continue monitoring until March 4. Global situation is severe, with Japan reporting over 80,000 cases last year - the highest on record.

- **Mpox (Monkeypox)**: UKHSA continues updating clade Ib and clade IIb epidemiological overview (updated 2/12), maintaining surveillance.

- **Influenza**: Taiwan at peak influenza season, with 529 severe cases and 97 deaths this season. Approximately 93,000 doses of government-funded vaccine remain available.

- **Nipah Virus Disease**: Outbreak in West Bengal, India continues under monitoring, with UKHSA adding it to the HCID risk list. Taiwan plans to list "Nipah virus infection" as a Category 5 notifiable disease by mid-March.

- **Avian Influenza H5N1**: Winter peak continues with 30 human infections globally in 2025. Taiwan maintains Level 2 travel advisory for China and Cambodia.

### Resolved / Downgraded

- **Tuberculosis Information Handbook**: New item last week, now incorporated into routine resource library.

## Global Epidemic Overview

### Emerging Threats

#### UKHSA First Cold Mortality Report - United Kingdom
{: #cold-mortality}

<p class="key-answer" data-question="How does cold weather affect health">Cold weather affects health primarily through indirect pathways such as heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory problems rather than direct hypothermia. These effects may manifest days or even weeks after exposure.</p>

UKHSA published its first annual cold mortality monitoring report on February 18, revealing the hidden health impacts of cold weather:

**Key Findings (Winter 2024-25)**:

| Cold Wave Event | Duration | Deaths |
|-----------------|----------|--------|
| November cold wave | Short-term | 421 |
| Early January (first) | Short-term | 493 |
| Early January (main event) | 6 days | 1,630 |
| **Total** | - | **2,544** |

**High-Risk Groups**:
- Adults aged 65+ (risk increases sharply above age 85)
- Cardiovascular or respiratory disease patients
- Dementia patients
- Those in fuel poverty or poorly insulated housing

**Mortality Timing Effects**:
- Mortality peaks approximately **5 days** after cold exposure
- Cardiac-related deaths appear with delayed onset
- Respiratory and infection-related deaths have longer delays

<blockquote class="expert-quote">
Even short-term cold can lead to significant increases in mortality, typically occurring days or weeks after exposure.
<cite>— Dr Agostinho Sousa, UKHSA Chief Medical Advisor, 2026-02-18</cite>
</blockquote>

**Vulnerability Trends**: Compared to the past five years, mortality risk rises more steeply as temperatures drop, potentially driven by population aging and increased disease burden.

| 2021-02-18 | Death Rates Attributed to Excessive Cold or Hypothermia (US) | US CDC MMWR | 0.57 |

#### Foodborne Bacteria Antimicrobial Resistance - Europe
{: #amr-europe}

<p class="key-answer" data-question="What is the current status of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne bacteria in Europe">Ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter remains persistently high, with ciprofloxacin no longer recommended for Campylobacter infections. The rising detection of carbapenemase-producing E. coli in food-producing animals is a serious warning sign.</p>

ECDC and EFSA published a joint report on February 18:

**Key Findings**:

| Resistance Type | Status | Risk Assessment |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Ciprofloxacin | High resistance in Salmonella, Campylobacter | No longer recommended for Campylobacter |
| Ampicillin, Tetracyclines, Sulfonamides | Widespread resistance | Continued monitoring |
| Carbapenems | Rising carbapenemase-producing E. coli detection | **Serious warning** |

**Critical Carbapenem Warning**:
- Multiple countries detecting carbapenemase-producing E. coli in food-producing animals and meat
- Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics for humans, not authorized for animal use
- Source requires further investigation

**Improving Trends**:
- Human Salmonella ampicillin resistance: declining in 19 countries
- Broiler tetracycline resistance declining
- Erythromycin resistance declining in multiple countries

**Recommendation**: Adopt **One Health strategy**, coordinating actions across human health, animal health, and food production sectors.

#### RSV Vaccine Programme Progress - United Kingdom

<p class="key-answer" data-question="Who is eligible for RSV vaccine in the UK programme">The UK RSV vaccine programme targets pregnant women (to protect infants), adults aged 75+, and care home residents.</p>

UKHSA published the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine Patient Group Direction (PGD) template on February 17:

**Target Groups**:
